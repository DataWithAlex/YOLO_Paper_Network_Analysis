      <data key="d3">We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.</data>

The premise is the need for value capture along the chain by increasing fitness for purpose (quality) if growers are to receive additional payments and consumers are to receive greater satisfaction. It shows that actions taken by intermediaries (marketing efforts, purchasing goals) can affect final products and that needs change over time and in different locations. Finally, it reviews how supermarket loyalty card data can be used to determine segmented consumer attitudes to purchasing decisions. This is in terms of elasticities, cross elasticities and time dependant purchasing. By incorporating basket information, loyalty card data can also provide indications of product usage. Taken together these data can inform marketing decisions as well as indicate when, where and how businesses should interact with the value chain to improve their returns by enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness.</data>

Its structure and principle for energy conversion have been one of the most important and difficult topics in photosynthetic research. Since 2011, the breakthrough of the crystal structure of PSII reveals the detailed structures of key chromospheres, cofactors and the catalytic center for water-splitting (OEC), which provides a blueprint for the research of artificial photosynthesis. Recently, we have succeeded to synthesize the first artificial Mn4Ca-cluster that has very similar structures and physicochemical properties as that of the natural OEC in PSII. All these advances pave a new avenue for artificial photosynthesis to utilize the solar energy and water to generate clean energy in future.

The aftershocks after an earthquake provide important data for future hazard assessments in seismically active regions. Fan and Shearer tackle the challenge of identifying aftershocks that occur within seconds of the main earthquake. It turns out that large dynamically triggered aftershocks—earthquakes caused by the mainshock—are more common than previously recognized.

A hallmark property of the neuronal network in the hippocampus of the brain is its ability to retrieve patterns from partial or noisy cues. This process is called pattern completion. Despite the importance of pattern completion for memory retrieval, its underlying synaptic mechanisms are poorly understood. By simultaneously recording from up to eight neurons, Guzman et al. found sparse connections between CA3 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and few synaptic contacts. Computational modeling revealed that such concise macroscopic and microscopic connectivity combine to ensure efficient memory storage and retrieval in this brain region.

      <data key="d3">Many tests for comparing survival curves have been proposed over the last decades. There are two branches, one based on weighted log-rank statistics and other based on weighted Kaplan-Meier statistics. If we carefully choose the weight function, a substantial increase in power of tests against non-proportional alternatives can be obtained. However, it is difficult to specify in advance the types of survival differences that may actually exist between two groups. Therefore, a combination test can simultaneously detect equally weighted, early, late or middle departures from the null hypothesis and can robustly handle several non-proportional hazard types with no a priori knowledge of the hazard functions. In this paper, we focus on the most used and the most powerful test statistics related to these two branches which have been studied separately but not compared between them. Through a simulation study, we compare the size and power of thirteen test statistics under proportional hazards and different types of non-proportional hazards patterns. We illustrate the procedures using data from a clinical trial of bone marrow transplant patients with leukemia.</data>

Though one cannot completely rule out that market-to-book and size factors may already capture the information of Trucosts’ total damage measure, the authors attempt to attribute the effect to risk, a persistent desirable characteristic or a short-run attention effect. Design/methodology/approach - The authors construct portfolios of stocks using the Trucost data for identifying more environmentally friendly companies. The authors then compare the risk-adjusted returns of the green portfolios to the non-green portfolios. A secondary analysis of the price impact of being listed on the Findings - The authors find that green stock returns outperform the most polluting stocks by 3.7 percent per year on a risk-adjusted basis. The evidence is most consistent with a significant but economically small attention effect coupled with a longer lasting and greater magnitude desirable characteristic driving green returns. The authors do not find evidence of a risk-contribution to the performance after controlling for well-known factors. Practical implications - Fund managers may benefit from this research in selecting green stocks, and thereby enhancing investment performance, with desirable characteristics without fear of increasing risk. Social implications - One social implication is that investing in sustainable and green firms may not only be beneficial for the common good but also for the investor. Increased capital flows, and hence lower borrowing costs, for green firms may assist in creating a more ecologically sustainable economy.

      <data key="d1">2016</data>
      <data key="d2">Enrico Franco; Mike Ristic; Marc Rea; Wladyslaw M. W. Gedroyc</data>
      <data key="d3">PURPOSE
Percutaneous ablation under MRI-guidance allows treating otherwise inoperable liver tumors locally using a catheter probe. However, manually placing the probe is an error-prone and time consuming task that requires a considerable amount of training. The aim of this paper was to present a pneumatically actuated robotic instrument that can assist clinicians in MRI-guided percutaneous intervention of the liver and to assess its functionality in a clinical setting. The robot positions a needle-guide inside the MRI scanner bore and assists manual needle insertions outside the bore.


METHODS
The robot supports double oblique insertions that are particularly challenging for less experienced clinicians. Additionally, the system employs only standard imaging sequences and can therefore be used on different MRI scanners without requiring prior integration. The repeatability and the accuracy of the robot were evaluated with an optical tracking system. The functionality of the robot was assessed in an initial pilot study on two patients that underwent MRI-guided laser ablation of the liver.


RESULTS
The robot positioned the needle-guide in a repeatable manner with a mean error of 0.35 mm and a standard deviation of 0.32 mm. The mean position error corresponding to the needle tip, measured for an equivalent needle length of 195 mm over 25 fixed points, was 2.5 mm with a standard deviation of 1.2 mm. The pilot study confirmed that the robot does not interfere with the equipment used for MRI-guided laser ablation and does not visibly affect the MR images. The robot setup integrated seamlessly within the established clinical workflow. The robot-assisted procedure was successfully completed on two patients, one of which required a complex double oblique insertion. For both patients, the insertion depth and the tumor size were within the range reported for previous MRI-guided percutaneous interventions. A third patient initially enrolled in the pilot study and was considerably heavier than the others, preventing the use of the robot and requiring several freehand insertion attempts.


CONCLUSIONS
The robot repeatability and accuracy are appropriate for liver tumors normally treated with MRI-guided ablation. The results of the pilot study endorse the clinical use of the robot in its current form: the robot is fully functional and MRI-compatible in a clinical setting and is suitable for double-oblique needle insertions.</data>

Mass incarceration has not been just the widespread removal of individual social isolates and deviants from society, but has also been the removal of parents and family members from homes and communities. First, this review discusses the racial implications of a vast and multidimensional, punitive and stigmatizing, criminal justice system. The review then focuses on the intergenerational effects of mass incarceration that limit intergenerational mobility, such as the reduced educational attainment of those experiencing parental incarceration. Using existing literature in the field, the review highlights the workings of intergenerational transmissions of stigma and strain in the production of disadvantage for children of incarcerated parents. Finally, the need for more restorative forms of justice is discussed.</data>

      <data key="d2">Ken Sato</data>
      <data key="d3">Vesicular transport of cargo molecules between intracellular organelles is mediated by vesicular carriers, which are formed by the regulated assembly of coat proteins on the donor organelle. Transport vesicle formation from the ER employs a small GTPase (Sar1) to regulate the assembly of the COPII coat and to drive the formation of COPII vesicles that mediate transport to the Golgi apparatus. In all eukaryotic cells examined to date, COPII vesicles appear to arise from specialized subdomains of the ER, known as “transitional ER” (tER) or “ER exit sites” (ERES). The essential and evolutionally conserved peripheral ER protein Sec16 has been characterized as a key player in the establishment of tER/ERES. Sec16 has been shown to interact with multiple COPII components, and more recent studies have revealed that Sec16 acts as a negative regulator of COPII turnover by slowing Sar1 GTPase activity. Therefore, Sec16 has been proposed to act as a scaffold to recruit COPII components and as a regulator of COPII turnover ([1] and references therein). A recent work by Glick using the budding yeast Pichia pastoris shows that displacement of COPII from tER sites also displaces Sec16. Moreover, the central conserved domain of P. pastoris Sec16, which had been implicated in coordinating COPII assembly, is dispensable for the formation of normal tER structure. These experimental data prompted Glick to propose that Sec16</data>

In response to various stresses, the transcription factor p53 is stabilized and activated, and acts as the “guardian of the genome,” by regulating the expression of hundreds of genes that affect cellular metabolism, or promote cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In this issue, Paul Lieberman presents another mechanism through which p53 might guard the genome [1]. Lieberman and coworkers recently identified retrotransposon-derived p53 binding sites in subtelomeric regions, and provided evidence that upon activation, p53 binds to these sites and induces the expression of enhancerRNAs, to promote the expression of subtelomeric genes and of telomererepeat encoding RNA (TERRA). Although the precise mechanisms remain unclear, p53 binding to these sites correlated with local histone acetylation, reduced accumulation of subtelomeric g-H2AX, and increased in the interaction of Shelterin proteins TRF1 and TRF2 with telomeric and/or subtelomeric DNA. The deletion of a subtelomeric p53 binding site led to loss of TERRA transcription and to telomere dysfunction, providing evidence for a physiological relevance of these observations [2].

      <data key="d3">This article provides an overview of the neurobiology of orofacial pain as well as the neural processes underlying sleep, with a particular focus on the mechanisms that underlie pain and sleep interactions including sleep disorders. Acute pain is part of a hypervigilance system that alerts the individual to injury or potential injury of tissues. It can also disturb sleep. Disrupted sleep is often associated with chronic pain states, including those that occur in the orofacial region. The article presents many insights that have been gained in the last few decades into the peripheral and central mechanisms involved in orofacial pain and its modulation, as well as the circuits and processes in the central nervous system that underlie sleep. Although it has become clear that sleep is essential to preserve and maintain health, it has also been found that pain, particularly chronic pain, is commonly associated with disturbed sleep. In the presence of chronic pain, a circular relationship may prevail, with mutual deleterious influences causing an increase in pain and a disruption of sleep. This article also reviews findings that indicate that reducing orofacial pain and improving sleep need to be targeted together in the management of acute to chronic orofacial pain states in order to improve an orofacial pain patient’s quality of life, to prevent mood alterations or exacerbation of sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing) that can negatively affect their pain, and to promote healing and optimize their health.</data>

      <data key="d3">microRNA dysregulation is a common feature of cancer cells, but the complex roles of microRNAs in cancer are not fully elucidated. Here we used functional genomics to identify oncogenic microRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate their impact on response to EGFR targeting therapy. Our data demonstrates that microRNAs with an AAGUGC-motif in their seed-sequence increase both cancer cell proliferation and sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. Using miR-372 as a prototypic AAGUGC-miRNA we set out to identify target mRNAs and an explanation to the discovered phenotype. Global transcriptomics, proteomics and target prediction, resulted in the identification of more than 500 candidate target mRNAs, including several tumor suppressors involved in the G1/S transition. The clinical relevance of our findings were evaluated by analysis of public domain data of NSCLC patients, revealing that almost 200 of the candidate target mRNAs showed a negative correlation to AAGUGC-miRNAs. In addition, the analysis of NSCLC clinical data supported the link between this microRNA seed-family and cancer cell proliferation and indicated that high expression of this type of microRNAs is associated with shorter relapse free survival. Expanding the analysis to include additional types of cancer revealed large differences in expression of AAGUGC-miRNA both within and between cancer types. In general the results from the analysis of NSCLC was replicated in other cancer types, where expression of AAGUGC-miRNAs was associated with decreased mRNA levels of tumor suppressor targets and increased expression of genes involved in proliferation. In conclusion we propose that AAGUGC-microRNAs are an integral part of an oncogenic signaling network, and that these findings have potential therapeutic implications, especially in selecting patients for EGFR-targeting therapy.

      <data key="d3">Amyloidosis is a group of disorders that can manifest in virtually any organ system in the body and is thought to be secondary to misfolding of extracellular proteins with subsequent deposition in tissues. The precursor protein that is produced in excess defines the specific amyloid type. This requires histopathological confirmation using Congo red dye with its characteristic demonstration of green birefringence under cross-polarized light. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are common and the degree of organ involvement dictates the symptoms that a patient will experience. The small intestine usually has the most amyloid deposition within the GI tract. Patients generally have nonspecific findings such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and dysphagia that can often delay the proper diagnosis. Liver involvement is seen in a majority of patients, although symptoms typically are not appreciated unless there is significant hepatic amyloid deposition. Pancreatic involvement is usually from local amyloid deposition that can lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, patients may undergo either endoscopic or radiological evaluation; however, these findings are usually nonspecific. Management of GI amyloidosis primarily aims to treat the underlying amyloid type with supportive measures to alleviate specific GI symptoms. Liver transplant is found to have positive outcomes, especially in patients with specific variants of hereditary amyloidosis.</data>

Most of the conventional studies do not emphasize on these practical constraints. The objective function of the problem also di ﬀ ers for each case. For instance, minimizing the operational Abstract We propose an application of a two-phase decomposition algorithm for a practical airline crew rostering problem for fair working time. The problem is to ﬁnd an optimal assignment of duties to individual crew members such that various hard constraints such as rest days, rules and regulations are satisﬁed. The objective is to minimize the total deviation of the average working time from the standard working time for crew members. A two-phase decomposition algorithm is successfully applied to solve the problem. The proposed method decomposes the original problem into the master problem and the subproblem.

      <data key="d3">ABSTRACT Introduction: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Their etiology is multifactorial, with complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, which are still largely unclear. Areas covered: The influence of genetics is clearly demonstrated by important epidemiological data, including familial aggregation and concordance in twins. In 2001, the first genetic susceptibility gene for IBD, the NOD2 gene, was identified. Currently, thanks to genetic wide association studies, over 200 susceptibility genetic markers are know. Expert commentary: However, clinically highly relevant gene associations are still very limited and the usefulness of these information in the current clinical strategies for treatment and surveillance of IBD is weak. Nevertheless, the recent identification of some genetic risk variants has clarified some newbiological pathways of these diseases thus paving the way for the discoveries in the near future of new targeted therapies.</data>

      <data key="d3">ABSTRACT Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is an enzyme overexpressed in many hypoxic tumors as a consequence of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) transcription factor cascade. CA IX is a highly active catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate and protons, being involved in pH regulation, but also contributes to the acquisition of metastasic phenotypes and to chemoresistance with some widely used anticancer drugs. CA IX inhibition with small molecules or antibodies has profound antitumor/antimetastatic effects, and also depletes the number of cancer stem cells within the hypoxic niche, all factors crucial for new generation anticancer agents. The present patent proposes a CA IX score, which considers both the staining intensity as well as the percentage of cells stained at a specific range of intensities, conventionally taken between 0 (no staining) and 3 (very strong staining). Based on the CA IX score, it was proposed that only patients with the score in the range of 2.0 – 2.6 should be given antitumor therapies comprising CA IX inhibitors such as the monoclonal antibody girentuximab or small molecule inhibitors.</data>

      <data key="d3">Modern electrical systems have a significant presence of electronic loads, which in turn produce negative impacts on distribution systems and loads, this has motivated their study to be increasingly prioritized, aiming to reduce their impacts from corrective actions. Harmonics are classified as positive, negative, and zero sequence, and their impacts on loads can vary according to the harmonic present. In the case of electric motors, negative sequence harmonics result in the greatest impacts. This work presents a classifier of existing harmonics in the input waveform of electric motors classes IE2, IE3 and IE4 using artificial neural networks (ANN), for that purpose, negative (2nd), positive (7th) and zero sequence harmonics (3rd) were applied separately and combined in the electric motors, the data was exported for a classification algorithm to identify existing harmonics. The results show how the algorithm presents good approximations of the present harmonics, mainly with those of positive and negative sequence.</data>

      <data key="d3">OBJECTIVE
This study evaluated three domains of job burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment) and factors associated with burnout in a national sample of peer specialists (PSs) employed at 138 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) health care systems in 49 states.


METHODS
Data were drawn from an observational study in which participants (N=152) completed online, self-report surveys about their mental health recovery, quality of life, and employment experiences at baseline, six months, and 12 months. Levels of burnout were analyzed at each time point, and regression analyses that controlled for baseline levels identified potential predictors of burnout (demographic, clinical, and employment characteristics) at six and 12 months.


RESULTS
Compared with previously published burnout levels of other mental health workers in the VHA, PSs reported similar levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. At baseline, increased burnout was correlated with white race, fewer hours providing direct services, greater psychiatric symptoms, and lower self-efficacy. However, analyses did not reveal strong predictors of burnout scores at six or 12 months.


CONCLUSIONS
In the first study to prospectively examine job burnout among PSs employed by the VHA, results illustrate the nuanced experience of burnout over a 12-month period and suggest the need for replication and further research on employment experiences of this emerging workforce.</data>

The problem in a flat setting for the regime of a stationary pulsating liquid movement in the cannel under the suggested difference of pressure at its butt end is considered. Deflections of plate are modeled as one-mass system elastic displacements. Parameters of one-mass system were found by using method of equivalent mass. The formulated boundary problem represents non-linear Navier-Stocks equations system for viscous incompressible liquid layer and the equation of one-mass system. The conditions of liquid adhesion to impenetrable channel walls and the condition of free leakage of liquid at channel butt ends are presented in the paper as the boundary ones. The linearization of the problem by means of perturbation method is made.

      <data key="d3">A vital aspect of Indian Classical music (ICM) is raga, which serves as a melodic framework for compositions and improvisations for both traditions of classical music. In this work, we propose a CNN-based sliding window analysis on mel-spectrogram and modgdgram for raga recognition in Carnatic music. The impor- tant contribution of the work is that the pro- posed method neither requires pitch extraction nor metadata for the estimation of raga. CNN learns the representation of raga from the pat- terns in the melspectrogram/ modgdgram dur- ing training through a sliding-window analysis. We train and test the network on sliced-mel- spectrogram/modgdgram of the original audio while the nal inference is performed on the au- dio as a whole. The performance is evaluated on 15 ragas from the CompMusic dataset. Multi- stream fusion has also been implemented to identify the potential of two feature representations. Multi-stream architecture shows promise in the proposed scheme for raga recognition.</data>

      <data key="d3">ABSTRACT The common scoter Melanitta nigra, velvet scoter M. fusca and long-tailed duck Clangula hyemalis (Aves: Anatidae) are among the more abundant sea ducks on the southern coast of the Baltic in winter, but their parasitic trematode fauna (Platyhelminthes, Digenea) in this region is little known. The aim of this study, conducted in 2007–2009, was a general comparison of the trematode fauna of these ducks in NW Poland. The prevalence and intensity of trematode infection were 68.3% and 119.9 in common scoter (101 examined), 77.6% and 13.1 in velvet scoter (58 examined) and 70.6% and 23.7 in long-tailed duck (68 examined). The following trematodes were found: Diplostomum pungitii, Apatemon gracilis, Australapatemon minor, Typhlocoelum sisowi, Echinochasmus spinulosus, Echinoparyphium recurvatum, Psilostomum brevicolle, Psilotrema simillimum, Catatropis verrucosa, Notocotylus attenuatus, N. gibbus, Paramonostomum alveatum, Prosthogonimus ovatus, Levinseniella propinqua, Gymnophallus bursicola and Cryptocotyle concava. The common scoter differs from the velvet scoter and long-tailed duck in its statistically significantly higher prevalence of G. bursicola; from long-tailed duck in its higher prevalence and greater intensity of infection with P. alveatum; and from velvet scoter in its greater intensity of infection with C. concava. The velvet scoter is distinguished from the long-tailed duck by its greater intensity of infection with P. brevicolle, lower prevalence of L. propinqua and lower intensity of infection with C. concava. Links between the differences found and the biology and ecology of the hosts, as well as the means of transmission of the parasites, are also discussed.</data>

The main purpose of this work is the design, fabrication, and experimentally characterization of PVC ternary composites. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) core-shell rubber particles and nano-CaCO3 particles were employed to modify hard PVC simultaneously. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and mechanical test were used to evaluate the properties of the composites. Mathematical models for the mechanical properties of PVC ternary composites were investigated by using a method combining design of experiments (DOE), Kriging surrogate model, and data analysis to investigate the various weight ratios addition of nano-CaCO3 and ABS on the mechanical properties of compounded PVC and predict mechanical properties associated to the studied composites. Benefiting from the proposed strategy, more reliable results and accurate predictions of mechanical properties of the nanocomposites can be extracted from Kriging surrogate model. POLYM. ENG.

Microbial antibiotic resistance arises in large, complex natural environments over time. Baym et al. developed a large culturing device in which they studied the emergence of resistance over space, time, and increasing antibiotic concentrations (see the Perspective by McNally and Brown). Diverse patterns of mutations always resulted in resistance. Sometimes resistance came with a cost to growth, requiring compensatory mutations to regain fitness. Sometimes mutator phenotypes arose. Unexpectedly, the most fit mutants were not necessarily the lineages that emerged to invade regions with higher antibiotic concentrations. Often, outgrowths trapped even more resistant lineages behind them. This observatory allows regular sampling to monitor rates and sequences of mutation and can be modified for a range of model organisms and evolutionary questions.

To address this issue, Turtle et al. treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with CAR-T cells prepared from strictly defined subsets. By carefully controlling the ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells, treatment conditions can be characterized that correlate with therapeutic response and toxicity, including the drug regimen before CAR-T treatment.

Paradoxically, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by markedly increased plasma ADPN levels and increased cardiovascular risk. In spite of the cardioprotective properties attributed to adiponectin, cardiovascular complications remain the main cause of mortality in the ESRD population. Furthermore, these patients have enhanced chronic inflammation, increased insulin resistance and persistent protein-energy wasting. Studies of the impact of ADPN on clinical outcomes among ESRD patients have so far yielded contradictory results.

Cancer patients are often matched to targeted therapies on the basis of the specific driver mutations present in their tumors. For an emerging group of therapies, Mayers et al. find that the metabolism of a target tumor may be a key determinant of its response and may be determined by the tumor's tissue of origin, not mutation status alone (see the Perspective by Vousden and Yang). They traced the fate of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in mouse models of lung and pancreatic cancer that were initiated with identical driver mutations. Lung tumors showed increased uptake and utilization of BCAA nitrogen for amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis. In contrast, pancreatic tumors showed decreased uptake of free BCAAs. These differences indicate that the tissue of origin shapes tumor metabolism and should be considered when matching patients with therapies.

A long-standing problem in geochemistry is the sequestration of iron-loving elements into the core of early Earth. Rather than causing the observed depletion of these elements in the mantle, Rubie et al. contend that metal segregation during the formation of Earth's core should have increased mantle concentrations. This is because of the high-pressure conditions of core formation that prevailed for Earth when Jupiter was executing its “Grand Tack” through the solar system. The sulfur concentrations in the magma oceans of early Earth became very high during accretion and, as Earth cooled, liquid iron sulfide stripped the mantle of the iron-loving elements, explaining the observed depletion.

Around the world, tens of thousands of dams regulate river flow and provide electrical power. By altering water and sediment flows, dams influence downstream ecosystems. In a Perspective, Poff and Schmidt explain that negative downstream effects can be ameliorated at low cost by managing either daily or seasonal water releases to make allowances for local ecosystem requirements. For example, avoiding water releases from a dam on the Colorado River for a few weekends each year could help large insects to recover, thereby also providing food for local fishes.

      <data key="d3">The rolling noise generated by railway vehicles was evaluated in scale-model tests. The similarity relations associated with wheel/rail noise were derived and the full-scale phenomena were estimated from the scale-model tests. When converting scale-model findings to full-scale, the frequency is scaled by the ratio 1/n, accelerances of rail and wheel vibration are scaled by the ratio 1/n3, and a logarithmic term is added to the sound pressure level. To verify the validity of these scaling relations, the scale-model measurements were compared with the results of field tests. Through measurements with an impact hammer, the vibration characteristics of the track and wheel were estimated in scale-model tests, were scaled using the proposed similarity laws, and were compared with field measurements of actual tracks and wheels. The quantitative trends of the actual characteristics were estimated well from the scale-model results. The field tests showed that, though the measured noise in the test rig had an unsuitable signal-noise ratio because of the greater driven noise of the test rig itself, the rail vibrations measured in the scale-model test did have a suitable signal-noise ratio. The rail vibration measured in the scale-model test is in good agreement with the measurements from the field tests. If noise from the test rig can be sufficiently reduced, or if rolling noise in the scale model is sufficiently large, we conclude that scale-model tests can simulate actual rolling noise.</data>

      <data key="d3">The Amaral Formation has a wide geographic distribution within the Lusitanian Basin, at the western Iberian Margin (Portugal). The different depositional contexts for this unit enabled the distinction of three sectors: lagoon, lagoon-barrier, and marine-distal. The integration of the evolutionary taphonomic analysis of its fossil assemblages with the analysis of multiscale properties through the CAMURES methodology (Multiscale Reservoir Characterization) allowed the application of a methodology for the classification of coquina which was previously developed for the Morro do Chaves Formation (Sergipe–Alagoas Basin, Brazil). Here, it was adapted according to the complexity of the Amaral Formation deposits. The classification of ten taphofacies, in association with four lithofacies, allowed the definition of 84 petrofacies, based on the nature of the sedimentary and taphonomic processes. The relationship between the structural context, the systems tracts, the diversity of the fossil record, the classification of taphofacies and petrofacies, and the understanding of vertical and lateral variations of the sediments’ deposition within the unit support the construction of geological and theoretical models for coquina deposits. These models will allow for prediction of the spatial distribution of facies in other coquina analogous hydrocarbon reservoirs, as well as specifying the delimitation of reservoir zones for 3D geocellular modeling and flow simulation of hydrocarbon-producing reservoirs, thus improving predictive analyses.</data>

      <data key="d1">2022</data>
      <data key="d2">Davood Fereidooni; Luís Sousa</data>
      <data key="d3">Rock is used as a foundation and building material in many engineering projects and it is important to determine/predict its engineering properties before project construction. Petrographic and textural characteristics are useful parameters for predicting engineering properties of rocks in such applications. In this research, fifteen rock samples were taken and their engineering characteristics, namely dry and saturated unit weights, porosity, water absorption, slake durability index (SDI), Schmidt rebound hardness (SRH), ultrasonic P-wave velocity (UPV), and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), were measured in the laboratory. Petrographic and textural characteristics of the rocks, determined from thin section and X-ray diffraction investigations, led to the evaluation of the texture coefficient (TC). Based on simple regression analysis (SRA), the TC values have direct relationships with density, SDI, SRH, UPV, and UCS, and inverse relationships with porosity and water absorption. Experimental models were developed using multiple regression analysis (MRA) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict Id2, SRH, UPV, and UCS of the tested rocks from the values of TC. Some statistical parameters including Pearson regression coefficient (R), coefficient values account for (VAF), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and performance index (PI) were calculated to assess the performances of the MRA and ANN models. The correlations between experimental and calculated values of Id2, SRH, UPV, and UCS indicated that predicted values of the ANN models are more valid than the MRA. Additionally, the residual error of the ANN models varies less than the MRA. Finally, it has been concluded that the SRA, MRA, and ANN methods can successfully predict the rock engineering properties from the TC.</data>

      <data key="d3">The spatial and temporal variability of dryness conditions in the territory of Kazakhstan during the period 1979–2021 was investigated using monthly and hourly ERA5 reanalysis data on air temperature and precipitation as well as various aridity indices. A large part of the territory is characterized by the air temperature increase in summer and spring, as well as precipitation reduction, especially during the summer months. It was shown that the end of the 20th century (1979–2000) and the beginning of the 21st century (2001–2021) are characterized by different trends in air temperature and precipitation. All applied indices, i.e., the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the Keetch–Byram Drought Index (KBDI), Standardized Precipitation (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration (SPEI), showed increased dryness in most parts of the territory of Kazakhstan. KBDI indicated an increased risk of wildfires, especially in the southwestern and northwestern regions. The hottest and driest areas are situated in the regions that are simultaneously affected by rising temperatures and reduced precipitation in spring and summer. The strongest increase in aridity and fire risk in the southwest and northwest is mainly due to reduced precipitation in the summer. Minimal risks of droughts occur in the northern and central regions, where conditions in the early 21st century became even less favorable for drought formation compared to the late 20th century (increased precipitation in both spring and summer and lower summer temperatures).</data>

      <data key="d3">In recent years, ethanol has attracted attention as an environmentally substitute fuel because of exhaustion of petroleum resources and environmental issues. In this study, we investigated emission by using the ethanol water solution from 45 to 60 vol.% concentrations under continuous combustion region by using the swirl burner. In addition, we investigated the flame behavior, influence of flame shape and flame length on the exhaust gas temperature and reduction of emission such as CO and NOX. Furthermore, the influence of the swirl flow by the supply air on the spray shape and the influence of the liquid film on the combustion characteristics were also examined. The exhaust gas temperature was measured in a combustion chamber and exhaust pipe by using K type thermocouples. The main conclusion are as follows: 1) The liquid film/liquid column ratio near the nozzle increases with decreasing the spray angle and the fuel flow rate at the low ethanol water solution (E45). 2) The continuous combustible regions are bigger with increasing the fuel flow rate at the low ethanol water solution (E45). 3) The exhaust gas temperature decreases monotonically with increasing the air ratio in spite of the spray angle and the fuel flow rate at low ethanol water solution (E45, E60). 4) The CO emission of high fuel flow rate remarkably decreases than that of low fuel flow rate at any spray angle for the ethanol water solution (E60) under the air ratio λ from 1 to 1.4. 5) It is possible to realize the less than 10 ppm NOX emission by using the ethanol water solution of E60 under the wide range of air ratios. 6) It is possible to reduce the simultaneous reduction of CO and NOX emissions for the ethanol water solution (E60) under the high air ratio.</data>

      <data key="d1">2022</data>
      <data key="d2">Evan Usler</data>
      <data key="d3">PURPOSE
Despite ambiguity in meaning and usage, "fluency" has played a central role in the understanding and treatment of developmental stuttering. The appropriateness of the term fluency in association with so-called fluency disorders, such as stuttering, has recently been questioned. The purpose of this article is to propose that fluency is best conceptualized as the efficiency of goal-directed action through cybernetic function. Spoken utterances are examples of sequences of action for the fulfillment of a hierarchy of nested and increasingly abstract social goals, including behaviors (e.g., introducing oneself) and values (e.g., being a sociable person). In contrast, some moments of speech disfluency, such as stuttering disfluencies, are inefficiencies in goal-directed action that may or may not hinder the fulfillment of higher level communicative behaviors and values, described here as communicative fluency.


CONCLUSIONS
The concept of communicative fluency refers to the continual, reliable, and upward fulfillment of increasingly abstract social goals in the form of communicative actions, behaviors, and values. This expanded conceptualization of fluency beyond simply speech production has the potential to be a useful indicator of psychosocial well-being for individuals who stutter.</data>

The study involved the organization of the analysis corpus and the subsequent content analysis of the selected documents. The documents included in this corpus are the official educational documents on the teaching and learning of Natural Sciences in Basic Education (1st to 9th grade—ages 6 to 15): the Essential Learning and two transversal documents (the Student Profile on Leaving Compulsory Schooling and the Environmental Education Framework for Sustainability). The obtained results show that these documents frame and guide the implementation of Education for Sustainable Development, in all its dimensions, throughout basic education.

A special feature of the outlined RDE tests is that they were performed in Polish road conditions, and thus their parameters may differ from their counterparts adopted in most European Union countries. Based on the findings vehicle emission conformity factors were developed, characterized as the fractional increase (or decrease) of traffic emissions during the homologation test or under normal operation conditions in relation to the emission limit standards (for chosen emission class) of the vehicle. Conducted research and the calculated conformity factors allowed for the environmental impact assessment of the vehicles of various emission classes, while also allowing early actions to restrict the emissions of selected components in passenger vehicles. The methods and measures used can also be applied to other types of vehicles (e.g. heavy duty or off-road vehicles) or vehicles powered by other fuels.</data>

To remove tracheal secretions through the intratracheal tube, catheter suction is used, and the suction catheter may be of the closed- or open-type. The catheters are cleaned by flushing with sterile 0.9% saline, resulting in dropping of dew. This phenomenon is caused by some factors: influence of flow, clogging of the suction tube, problem of manipulation of flushing and angle between the intubation tube and the connection port. But this dropping has not yet been investigated. In this study, we focused at this angle and we used the test lung which is simulated machine on behalf of patient. We consider two situations adult and child, also two types of catheters Eco-Cath and Ty-care. In child case we consider elbow-type suction catheters and Y-connector type. The angle was set at 0°, 20°, 40°, 60°, and 90°, and we observed the difference between Eco-Cath and Ty-care. In adults difference is significant (p 0.001), In 90° between Tracheal intubation and Tracheotomy (p ≈ 0.26). In child difference is significant (p 0.001), In 90° between Tracheal intubation and Tracheotomy (p ≈ 0.15). In child case we observed dependency of angle on various conditions too.

The fungus Stagonospora cirsii is able to produce phytotoxic stagonolides A (1), J (2), K (3) and herbarumin I (4) with high yield. The aim of this study was to create a set of structurally related nonenolides and to reveal the structural features that affect their biological activity. Stagonolide A (1) and C-7 oxidized stagonolide K (11) showed the highest phytotoxicity in leaf puncture assay and agar seedlings assay. The oxidation of C-7 hydroxyl group (as in 1, acetylstagonolide A (10) and (11) led to the manifestation of toxicity to microalgae, Bacillus subtilis and Sf9 cells regardless of the configuration of C-9 propyl chains (R in 1 and 10, S in 11). C-7 non-oxidized nonenolides displayed none or little non-target activity. Notably, 7S compounds were more phytotoxic than their 7R analogues. Due to the high inhibitory activity against seedling growth and the lack of side toxicity, mono- and bis(acetyl)- derivatives of herbarumin I were shown to be potent for the development of pre-emergent herbicides. The identified structural features can be used for the rational design of new herbicides.</data>

      <data key="d3">A direct numerical simulation of compressible turbulent channel flow at low Mach number(Ma = 0.3) subject to strong temperature gradient is conducted. The wall temperature ratios which are defined by a temperature on the upper wall divided by that on the lower one, are set to 2 and 3. It is shown that the flow of high temperature wall side is laminarized as increasing the wall temperature ratio. Moreover, compressible and dilatational motions are induced on the low and high temperature wall sides, respectively. The identity of friction coefficient originally derived by Fukagata et al.(2002) (so-called ‘FIK identity’) is extended to those of friction coefficient and Nusselt number on the compressible channel flow. It is revealed that the viscous variation component attains to 16 % of the friction coefficient on the case of high temperature ratio. Furthermore, the pressure work component occupies about 20 % of the overall Nusselt number for the all cases. The pressure work has a redistributive effect between mean kinetic energy and internal energy. The energy transfer from mean kinetic energy to internal energy appears on the low temperature side whereas that toward the opposite direction on the high temperature side at the present low Mach number flow.</data>

      <data key="d3">A numerical approach is one of feasible ways to discover the biomechanics of hallux valgus deformity with various osteotomy and fixation strategies. In the present study, two types of finite element models for analyzing the biomechanical performances of hallux valgus treatment with plate fixations were developed including the single first metatarsal bone model and the musculoskeletal lower extremity model. There are four types of plate fixations that were used to correct the deformity of hallux valgus. The strengths and limitations of both the single first metatarsal bone model and the musculoskeletal lower extremity model were evaluated and discussed. The results revealed that the single metatarsal bone models can be used to quickly predict the biomechanical performances of different hallux valgus treatments. Additionally, the musculoskeletal lower extremity models can be used to predict the biomechanical performances of different hallux valgus treatments under a physiological loading. The plate fixations with the insertion of all locking screws revealed better osteotomy fixation stability and lower risk of the implant failure compared to the other fixations. Additionally, the plate fixations with the insertion of six bone screws had lower risk of the metatarsal bone failure compared to the plate fixations with the insertion of four bone screws. The six holes plate with the insertion of six locking screws was the best treatment among the four treatment strategies. The numerical models and simulation techniques developed in the present study can provide useful information for understanding the biomechanics of hallux valgus treatments.</data>

      <data key="d3">New reliable biomarkers are needed to improve individual risk assessment for post‐transplant infection, acute graft rejection and other immune‐related complications after solid organ transplantation (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT). One promising strategy relies on the monitoring of replication kinetics of virome components as functional surrogate for the net state of immunosuppression. Torque Teno Virus (TTV) is a small, non‐enveloped, circular, single‐stranded DNA anellovirus with no attributable pathological effects. A major component of the human blood virome, TTV exhibits various features that facilitate its application as immune biomarker: high prevalence rates, nearly ubiquitous distribution, stable viral loads with little intra‐individual variability, insensitivity to antiviral drugs, and availability of commercial PCR assays for DNA quantification. The present review summarizes the available studies supporting the use of post‐transplant TTV viremia to predict patient and graft outcomes after SOT and allo‐HSCT. Taken together, this evidence suggests that high or increasing TTV DNA levels precede the occurrence of infectious complications in the SOT setting, whereas low or decreasing viral loads are associated with the development of acute rejection. The interpretation in allo‐HSCT recipients is further complicated by complex interplay with the underlying disease, conditioning regimen, and timing of recovery of lymphocyte counts, although TTV kinetics may act as a marker of immunological reconstitution at the early post‐transplant period. The standardization of PCR methods and reporting units for TTV DNAemia and the results from ongoing interventional trials evaluating a TTV load‐guided strategy to adjust immunosuppressive therapy are achievements expected in the coming years.</data>

      <data key="d3">High-throughput sequencing of amplicon libraries is the most widespread and one of the most effective ways to study the taxonomic structure of microbial communities, even despite growing accessibility of whole metagenome sequencing. Due to the targeted amplification, the method provides unparalleled resolution of communities, but at the same time perturbs initial community structure thereby reducing data robustness and compromising downstream analyses. Experimental research of the perturbations is largely limited to comparative studies on different PCR protocols without considering other sources of experimental variation related to characteristics of the initial microbial composition itself. Here we analyse these sources and demonstrate how dramatically they effect the relative abundances of taxa during the PCR cycles. We developed the mathematical model of the PCR amplification assuming the heterogeneity of amplification efficiencies and considering the compositional nature of data. We designed the experiment—five consecutive amplicon cycles (22–26) with 12 replicates for one real human stool microbial sample—and estimated the dynamics of the microbial community in line with the model. We found the high heterogeneity in amplicon efficiencies of taxa that leads to the non-linear and substantial (up to fivefold) changes in relative abundances during PCR. The analysis of possible sources of heterogeneity revealed the significant association between amplicon efficiencies and the energy of secondary structures of the DNA templates. The result of our work highlights non-trivial changes in the dynamics of real-life microbial communities due to their compositional nature. Obtained effects are specific not only for amplicon libraries, but also for any studies of metagenome dynamics.</data>

      <data key="d3">Background For effective tumor elimination, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells must recognize tumor-derived antigens presented on class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I). Despite a general association between the expression of immunogenic antigens, typically neoantigens, and response to immunotherapy, the majority of patients lack strong endogenous responses to most putative neoantigens due to mechanisms that are not well understood. Cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses are induced by dendritic cells (DCs) cross-presenting tumor-derived peptides on MHC-I. We hypothesized that cross presentation may form an unappreciated source of bias in the induction of cytotoxic T-cell responses. Methods We used stable isotope labeling of amino acids combined with immunopeptidomics to distinguish cross-presented from endogenous MHC-I peptides on DCs. To test impacts on T-cell activation, we targeted the model antigen SIINFEKL to specific subcellular compartments in tumor cells, which were used as sources for cross presentation to T cells. In vitro observations were validated using DNA and RNA sequencing data from two cohorts of patients with melanoma undergoing checkpoint blockade therapy. We used a novel quantitative mass spectrometry approach to measure the levels of model antigen on cross-presenting DCs following various means of tumor cell death. Results DCs exhibited a strong bias for cross-presenting peptides derived from cytoplasmic proteins and against those from plasma membrane proteins, which was confirmed using the model antigen SIINFEKL. In patients with melanoma, the proportion of membrane-derived neoantigens was correlated with reduced survival and failure to respond to therapy. Quantification of cross-presented SIINFEKL revealed that the mode of cell death could overcome DCs’ bias against plasma membrane proteins. Conclusions Cross presentation of cellular antigens by DCs may impose constraints on the range of peptides available to activate CD8+ T cells that have previously gone unappreciated. The share of neoantigens arising from membrane-derived sources may render some tumors less immunogenic due to inefficient cross presentation. These observations carry important implications for the encounter and intracellular processing of cellular antigens by DCs and merit further clinical studies for their therapeutic potential in stratifying patient populations and design of vaccine-based therapies.</data>

Em um primeiro momento, o artigo apresenta alguns aspectos da nocao de deus em Platao, mais especificamente no Timeu e na Republica, e depois, em uma segunda parte, apresentara a importância de Eros como motor do conhecimento filosofico na Simposio . Apresento de forma resumida os argumentos principais no dialogo Timeu de Platao que descrevem o Demiurgo, artesao do Cosmos, suas atividades e suas caracteristicas. Como modo a complementar certos tracos do que se poderia chamar de deus em Platao, apresento ainda algumas passagens em que se fala sobre deus e seus aspectos na Republica . Por fim, na segunda parte do artigo, analiso a Escada Erotica descrita por Diotima como sendo parte dos misterios elevados do Eros, presente no Simposio 210a. Palavras-Chave: Platao. Deus. Eros . Republica. Timeu. Simposio Resume Cet article veut montrer deux themes religieux en Platon : sa notion de dieu e la ascese erotique present dans le Symposium. En premier lieu, l’article montre quelques aspects de la notion de dieu chez Platon, en particulier dans le Timee et la Republique. Puis, en deuzieme partie, on montrera l’importance d’Eros comme moteur de la conaissance philosophique dans le Syposium. On resumera les principaux arguments du Timee qui decrivent le Demiurge, artisan du cosmos, ses activites et ses caracteristiques. Afin de completer certains aspects de ce qu’on pourrait appeler dieu chez Platon, l’article presente encore quelques passages ou on parle de dieu et ses aspects dans la Republique. Enfim, dans la seconde partie du texte, j’analyse l’Echelle Erotique, decrite par Diotime comme partie des Mysteres Eleves d’Eros et presente dans Symposium 210a. Mot-Cles: Platon. Dieu. Eros.

      <data key="d3">A low-profile microstrip patch antenna (MPA) operating in triple WLAN bands (2.4 /5.2 /5.8 GHz) with stable broadside radiation is proposed by employing TM
 10
, TM
 12
, and TM
 30
 modes. Firstly, the TM
 12
 mode of the MPA could be excited at around 5.8 GHz by properly selecting its dimensions. Meanwhile, a linear slot is etched out at the center of the radiating patch to transform the radiated fields of TM
 12
 and TM
 30
 modes into the broadside radiation with low sidelobe level. Secondly, the shorting pins are symmetrically loaded underneath the patch, aiming to improve the input impedance matching of TM
 10
 mode and push up its resonant frequency to around 2.4 GHz. Thirdly, a pair of parallel slots is near the radiating edges of the patch radiator, thus extending the surface current distribution of TM
 30
 mode and reallocating its resonant frequency to around 5.2 GHz. In final, the prototype antenna is fabricated and measured to validate its working principle. The results illustrate that this low-profile MPA makes these three radiative modes resonate at around 2.44, 5.22, and 5.82 GHz, respectively. Most importantly, a stable normal radiation pattern with low cross-polarisation and sidelobe levels is maintained for the proposed antenna as well.</data>

Abstract In the days we live in, the experience - exiled by modern stiffness to a status of alienation and ambiguity - is back to the front place  in the debate of ideas. This return, however, is not without problems. Among them stands out a certain ambiguity in understanding what is experience. This text seeks to reflect on the mystical experience. If the experience is back to the focus of interest today, with the mystical experience happens something similar. And the mystical experience therefore always seeks its identity in the midst of several ways to understand and identify. The text seeks to describe it as what it is: something eminently human.

      <data key="d3">ABSTRACT The archeological site RS-TQ-141 is located in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) and belongs to the pre-colonial Guarani Tradition (between fifth and seventeenth century). The site extends to the bank of the Taquari River. About 200 small fragments of ceramic from the site present internal and/or external coating surfaces. Archaeometry analyses were applied in order to understand coating application mechanism. X-ray Fluorescence (XFR) analyses revealed that the main elements are iron, titanium, potassium, and calcium. Applying the micro Fourier Transform Interferometer (ATR-FTIR) method it was possible to differentiate white and red coatings produced with different types of (ocher) clays. ATR-FTIR was applied in order to try to distinguish the vessels use. The coatings were produced with the same groups of clays used for the manufacture of ceramics. The presence of at least two groups of clay is recorded: montmorillonite-like and kaolinite-like. The white coatings can be distinguished in the FTIR spectra by the presence of a carbonate peak. From this research, there does not seem to be any difference between internal and external coatings. Carbonyl materials were detected, both in the coating and in the production of the ceramics; the latter is probably related to pyrolysis.</data>

      <data key="d3">Due to the success of oil and gas production, turbidites have become exploratory targets over the past 40 years in the rift and passive margin basins in the North and South Atlantic. The turbiditic reservoirs in rift and passive margin settings of Atlantic sedimentary basins located in Brazil (Campos Basin) and Portugal (Lusitanian Basin) represent potential economic units for the hydrocarbon exploration. However, despite being considered analogous reservoirs, these units present distinct potentials for the accumulation of hydrocarbons. In this context, the work presented discusses the results obtained from the analysis of static (source rock, reservoir rock, seal and trap) and dynamic elements (migration, tectonic, diagenetic and thermal processes) of both studied petroleum systems, using geological, seismic, well, geochemical and petrographic data. The developed methodology of multiscalar characterization of the two petroleum systems was successful, leading to a specific classification of the efficiency of the static and dynamic elements. These served as the basis for a petroleum systems analysis of the potential of turbiditic reservoirs in both analyzed basins. In the Campos Basin, the salt diapirs and the associated faults provided the origin of excellent migration routes for the hydrocarbons generated in lower intervals, allowing them to reach Cretaceous turbidite reservoirs. At Lusitanian Basin, the diagenetic processes reduced significantly the porosities of the potential turbiditic reservoirs, besides the intense influence of the salt tectonics that may have been responsible for the migration of hydrocarbons along faults or by their walls, towards upper formations and to the surface.</data>

      <data key="d2">Alissa Flatley; Ian Rutherfurd; Ross Hardie</data>
      <data key="d3">River relocation is the diversion of a river into an entirely new channel for part of their length (often called river diversions). Relocations have been common through history and have been carried out for a wide range of purposes, but most commonly to construct infrastructure and for mining. However, they have not been considered as a specific category of anthropogenic channel change. Relocated channels present a consistent set of physical and ecological challenges, often related to accelerated erosion and deposition. We present a new classification of river relocation, and present a series of case studies that highlight some of the key issues with river relocation construction and performance. Primary changes to the channel dimensions and materials, alongside changes to flow velocity or channel capacity, can lead to a consistent set of problems, and lead to further secondary and tertiary issues, such as heightened erosion or deposition, hanging tributaries, vegetation loss, water quality issues, and associated ecological impacts. Occasionally, relocated channels can suffer engineering failure, such as overtopping or complete channel collapse during floods. Older river relocation channels were constructed to minimise cost and carry large floods, and were straight and trapezoidal. In some countries, modern relocated channels represent an exciting new challenge in that they are now designed to replicate natural rivers, the success of which depends on understanding the characteristics, heterogeneity, and mechanisms at work within the natural channel. We discuss shortcomings in current practice for river relocation and highlight areas for future research for successful rehabilitation of relocated rivers.</data>

      <data key="d3">A digital object identifier (DOI) is an increasingly prominent persistent identifier in finding and accessing scholarly information. This paper intends to present an overview of global development and approaches in the field of DOI and DOI services with a slight geographical focus on Germany. At first, the initiation and components of the DOI system and the structure of a DOI name are explored. Next, the fundamental and specific characteristics of DOIs are described and DOIs for three (3) kinds of typical intellectual entities in the scholar communication are dealt with; then, a general DOI service pyramid is sketched with brief descriptions of functions of institutions at different levels. After that, approaches of the research data librarianship community in the field of RDM, especially DOI services, are elaborated. As examples, the DOI services provided in German research libraries as well as best practices of DOI services in a German library are introduced; and finally, the current practices and some issues dealing with DOIs are summarized. It is foreseeable that DOI, which is crucial to FAIR research data, will gain extensive recognition in the scientific world.</data>

      <data key="d3">Abstract Dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is known to occur after craniotomy, but mixed pial and dural AVF after craniotomy has not been reported. A 45-year-old man who had undergone surgical clipping of an unruptured aneurysm 2 years previously presented with small subcortical hemorrhage from mixed pial and dural AVF. Surgical disconnection could not be cured completely due to the granulomatous tissue around the aneurysm, and the presence of an undetected shunt. Postoperative digital subtraction angiography showed a new pial AVF supplied by the middle cerebral artery pial branches. Many branches were associated with the remnant aneurysm and pial AVF, so we did not try to embolize the fistula. Gamma knife surgery was performed as adjuvant radiotherapy, which achieved angiographically complete occlusion of the shunt points. Multimodal approaches including surgery, endovascular intervention, and radiotherapy are needed for radiological and clinical cure of mixed pial and dural AVF. Long-term follow up is essential.</data>

This eodiscide genus is known from the Cambrian Series 2 of England, Newfoundland, New York, Sweden and Russia. An emended diagnosis for the genus is provided, which is here assigned to Calodiscidae, and a new species, Chelediscus garzoni sp. nov. is described. The species comes from Cumbres de San Bartolomé municipality, northern Huelva province (Spain), in the upper part of the ‘Cumbres beds’ formation. This horizon is assigned to the regional upper Marianian Stage based on the trilobite assemblage (Serrodiscus Zone), correlating with the lowermost Cambrian Stage 4. Chelediscus carus Repina from the Botoman of Siberia and this Spanish occurrence are the earliest appearances of the genus. The new species suggests that a smooth, unlobed glabella is primitive for the genus. Chelediscus in Spain strengthens faunal links with Avalonia, Baltica, Siberia and Laurentia. urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:32A57670-48E7-470E-B7AD-A0ACACB2E5C6</data>

      <data key="d3">&lt;p&gt;Data publications with digital object identifiers (DOI) are best practice for FAIR sharing data. Originally developed with the purpose of providing permanent access to (static) datasets described in scholarly literature, DOI today are more and more assigned to dynamic data. These DOIs are providing a citable and traceable reference of various types of sources (data, software, samples, equipment) and means of rewarding the originators and institutions. As a result of international groups, like the Coalition on Publishing Data in the Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences (COPDESS) and the Enabling FAIR Data project, data with assigned DOIs are fully citable in scholarly literature and many journals require the data underlying a publication to be available &amp;#8211; even before accepting an article. Initial metrics for data citation allows data providers to demonstrate the value of the data collected by institutes and individual scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially relevant for the geodesy, because, geodesy researchers are often much more involved in operational aspects and data provision than researchers in other fields might be. Therefore, compared to other scientific disciplines, geodesy researchers appear to be producing less &amp;#8220;countable scientific&amp;#8221; output. Consequently, geodesy data and equipment require a structured and well-documented mechanism which will enable citability, scientific recognition and reward that can be provided by assigning DOI to data and data products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges and to identify opportunities for improved coordination and advocacy within the geodetic community, the International Association of Geodesy&amp;#8217;s (IAG) Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) has established a Working Group on &amp;#8220;Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for Geodetic Data Sets&amp;#8221; in 2019. This Working Group is designated to establish best practices and advocate for the consistent implementation of DOIs across all IAG Services and in the greater geodetic community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main objectives and activities of this working group are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) to identify what the community needs from consistent usage of DOIs for data in terms of being able to discover data, permanently cite data, and acknowledge the data providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(2) to develop recommendations for DOI minting strategies for different geodetic data types and granularity across IAG Services (static, dynamic, observational data, data products, combination products, networks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(3) to develop recommendations for a consistent method for data citation across all IAG Services, to support data providers, and to provide quantitative support detailing the use of geodetic datasets and other resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(4) to develop recommendations for connecting metadata standards for data discovery (e.g. DataCite, ISO19115) with community metadata standards (GeodesyML, Station Logs)&lt;/li&gt;

      <data key="d3">Hypoxia is a common pathway to the progression of end-stage kidney disease. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) encodes an RNA helicase that recognizes viruses including SARS-CoV2, which is responsible for the production of interferon (IFN)-α/β to prevent the spread of viral infection. Recently, RIG-I activation was found under hypoxic conditions, and klotho deficiency was shown to intensify the activation of RIG-I in mouse brains. However, the roles of these functions in renal inflammation remain elusive. Here, for in vitro study, the expression of RIG-I and IFN-α/β was examined in normal rat kidney (NRK)-52E cells incubated under hypoxic conditions (1% O2). Next, siRNA targeting RIG-I or scramble siRNA was transfected into NRK52E cells to examine the expression of RIG-I and IFN-α/β under hypoxic conditions. We also investigated the expression levels of RIG-I and IFN-α/β in 33 human kidney biopsy samples diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. For in vivo study, we induced renal hypoxia by clamping the renal artery for 10 min in wild-type mice (WT mice) and Klotho-knockout mice (Kl-/- mice). Incubation under hypoxic conditions increased the expression of RIG-I and IFN-α/β in NRK52E cells. Their upregulation was inhibited in NRK52E cells transfected with siRNA targeting RIG-I. In patients with IgA nephropathy, immunohistochemical staining of renal biopsy samples revealed that the expression of RIG-I was correlated with that of IFN-α/β (r = 0.57, P&lt;0.001, and r = 0.81, P&lt;0.001, respectively). The expression levels of RIG-I and IFN-α/β were upregulated in kidneys of hypoxic WT mice and further upregulation was observed in hypoxic Kl-/- mice. These findings suggest that hypoxia induces the expression of IFN-α/β through the upregulation of RIG-I, and that klotho deficiency intensifies this hypoxia-induced expression in kidneys.</data>

      <data key="d3">This paper proposes an advanced mesh generation technique that reuses the proven analysis models by similar sub-part search. The purpose of this development is to reduce interactive mesh improvement work time and to comply with the mesh specifications. The number of product specifications is increasing due to global business development and diversification of needs. Hence, the execution frequency of simulation is increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the working hours. Furthermore, quality improvement and standardization of analysis models are required because the general designers have learned to manage V&amp;V. This technique consists of two distinctive techniques. First, it is the technique to search the sub-parts from newly design CAD where have similar shape with the archived feature sub-parts contained in the proven CAD models. In this technique, the similar sub-parts are retrieved from a CAD model described by boundary representation and made correspondence relation surface pairs of a retrieval model (proven model) and a target model (CAD of new design). A similarity score is based on the attributed graphs of a retrieval model and a target model. And, this score is calculated by a geometrical similarity and topological similarity. Second, mesh can be generated automatically by arranging and merging the mesh of similar sub-parts. Experimental results show that this technique can efficiency achieve mesh generation without interactive mesh improvement operation.</data>

      <data key="d3">Forest ecosystems in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are significantly affected by frequent extreme weather events. How different forest ecosystems respond to these changes is a major challenge. This study aims to assess differences in the response of daily net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and latent heat flux (LE) between different boreal and temperate ecosystems and the atmosphere to extreme weather events (e.g., anomalous temperature and precipitation). In order to achieve the main objective of our study, we used available reanalysis data and existing information on turbulent atmospheric fluxes and meteorological parameters from the global and regional FLUXNET databases. The analysis of NEE and LE responses to high/low temperature and precipitation revealed a large diversity of flux responses in temperate and boreal forests, mainly related to forest type, geographic location, regional climate conditions, and plant species composition. During the warm and cold seasons, the extremely high temperatures usually lead to increased CO2 release in all forest types, with the largest response in coniferous forests. The decreasing air temperatures that occur during the warm season mostly lead to higher CO2 uptake, indicating more favorable conditions for photosynthesis at relatively low summer temperatures. The extremely low temperatures in the cold season are not accompanied by significant NEE anomalies. The response of LE to temperature variations does not change significantly throughout the year, with higher temperatures leading to LE increases and lower temperatures leading to LE reductions. The immediate response to heavy precipitation is an increase in CO2 release and a decrease in evaporation. The cumulative effect of heavy precipitations is opposite to the immediate effect in the warm season and results in increased CO2 uptake due to intensified photosynthesis in living plants under sufficient soil moisture conditions.</data>

      <data key="d3">The concept of weight management has gained currency in present political and social discourses on weight and health, organizing the various efforts to fight obesity and to assist individuals in controlling their weight. In this paper, we ask whether weight management is becoming rooted also in the everyday life of individuals. Adopting a practice-theoretical approach we study whether weight management constitutes an intelligible and distinct entity to people problematizing their weight. By analysing data generated by focus group discussions with Finnish consumers we investigate the ways in which people understand the concept of weight management, what kinds of techniques they use in order to manage their weight, and what kind of emotional and normative positions they take with respect to weight management. We analyse weight management in relation to eating, but acknowledge the role of another practices, such as exercising. We conclude that weight management is not a clearly defined entity, but located at the intersection of more established practices, healthy eating and slimming. We end our article by discussing the policy-implications of our findings.</data>

      <data key="d3">The main intention of this study is to propose general criteria for the locations of the control sources and error microphones that improve the performance of the active noise barrier. Based on the proposed criteria of this study, the greater reduction is attained when the diffracted field of the noise source is canceled with the diffracted field of the control sources, that is, it is suggested to locate the control sources on the incident side and below the path that connects the furthest point in the shadow zone to the edge of the barrier. Furthermore, it is suggested that the error microphones are most suitably placed on the shadow side of the barrier where they are under the diffracted field of both the primary and control sources. The results also show that with these general criteria, the active noise control achieves an extra reduction that varies from 14.9 to 3.9 dB (for the one-third octave bands from 63 Hz to 1 kHz) and 9.3 dB for the broadband noises.</data>

Linking nitrogen to the carbons in aryl rings is a common need in pharmaceutical chemistry. To do so, the carbon usually has to be adorned ahead of time with a reactive group, such as bromide. Paudyal et al. report a rhodium-catalyzed reaction that substitutes aryl C-H bonds with nitrogen groups directly to produce a wide variety of aromatic amines. Cleavage of a N-O bond in the nitrogen-bearing precursor drives the reaction with no need for an external oxidant. All of this can be done for both intermolecular and intramolecular couplings.

Cuprates usually acquire their superconductivity when charged carriers, typically holes, are chemically introduced into a “parent” state called a Mott insulator. However, this part of the cuprate phase diagram is rich in phases, including a pseudogap and a charge-order phase, whose relationship to each other and to superconductivity is under debate. Cai et al. used scanning tunneling spectroscopy of a very lightly doped Bi2Sr2–x LaxCuO6+δ to unravel the phase conundrum. As the hole dopants were introduced, a pseudogap-like density of states started to emerge, followed by a checker-board pattern characteristic of the charge order. When further doping caused the material to become superconductive, the charge-order pattern became less prominent, indicating a competition between the two phases.

The purse-seine tuna fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean, off the west coast of the Americas, is fished by vessels with thousand-ton capacities that range over an area the size of Canada. The large size of the fishery means that vessel distribution is patchy. Sun et al. developed a model to predict vessel distribution on the basis of decisions that skippers make before and after going to sea. The model accounts for environmental factors such as chlorophyll content and dissolved oxygen concentration, as well as weather conditions. Modeling the far-flung fishery can inform regulatory decisions aimed at ensuring a sustainable tuna fishery while minimizing dolphin mortality.

Chemists do not designate a compound as aromatic because it smells nice. Rather, the term refers to the stability conferred by a particular delocalized arrangement of electrons first characterized in benzene and related carbon rings. Is the concept exclusive to carbon? Over the years, inorganic chemists have extended it to a range of analogs composed of other elements, and now Seitz et al. introduce two more. Specifically, they prepared hexagonal benzene analogs in which three silicon centers alternate with either three phosphorus or three arsenic centers. Structural and computational characterization supported aromaticity. The reactions fortuitously also produced tetragonal cyclobutadiene analogs that were weakly antiaromatic.

Scientists are now scrambling to understand the cause. The disruption may be due to the strong El Nino this past year, a "blob" of warm waters in the northern Pacific Ocean, or a sudden stratospheric warming event this past year. Or climate change may be making the QBO vulnerable in a more fundamental way. In any case, one of forecasters9 reliable tools has become more shaky.

Shipping routes across the Arctic Ocean will multiply as climate warms.

Arctic sea ice is rapidly disappearing as climate warms, ushering in an entirely novel era in marine transportation with important economic implications, because more frequent open seas will allow increasing volumes of trans-Arctic shipping. Melia et al. used an ensemble of climate models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to project how sea ice loss might increase opportunities for ocean-going vessels to cross the Arctic. They find that standard open-water vessels will have twice as many navigable periods by the middle of the 21st century as they do now, including some across the central Arctic. The shipping season length could reach 4 to 8 months by late century, when moderately ice-strengthened vessels could be able to complete Arctic transits during 10 to 12 months of the year.

Iran kept its nuclear jalopy running decades longer than expected by scrounging for spare parts and by finding ways around international sanctions. In 2009, when the reactor was running low on fuel, negotiations broke down over Iran9s request to purchase low-enriched uranium fuel plates. Iran was soon producing its own fuel, thanks to a technological breakthrough: Its engineers had learned how to interconnect centrifuge cascades to enrich uranium to ever-higher levels.</data>

      <data key="d2">Tamma A. Carleton; Solomon M. Hsiang</data>
      <data key="d3">BACKGROUND For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research has begun to illuminate key linkages in the coupling of these complex natural and human systems, uncovering notable effects of climate on health, agriculture, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. ADVANCES Past scholars of climate-society interactions were limited to theorizing on the basis of anecdotal evidence; advances in computing, data availability, and study design now allow researchers to draw generalizable causal inferences tying climatic events to social outcomes. This endeavor has demonstrated that a range of climate factors have substantial influence on societies and economies, both past and present, with important implications for the future. Temperature, in particular, exerts remarkable influence over human systems at many social scales; heat induces mortality, has lasting impact on fetuses and infants, and incites aggression and violence while lowering human productivity. High temperatures also damage crops, inflate electricity demand, and may trigger population movements within and across national borders. Tropical cyclones cause mortality, damage assets, and reduce economic output for long periods. Precipitation extremes harm economies and populations predominately in agriculturally dependent settings. These effects are often quantitatively substantial; for example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields roughly 48%, warming trends since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by 11%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by 0.28 percentage points year−1. Much research aims to forecast impacts of future climate change, but we point out that society may also benefit from attending to ongoing impacts of climate in the present, because current climatic conditions impose economic and social burdens on populations today that rival in magnitude the projected end-of-century impacts of climate change. For instance, we calculate that current temperature climatologies slow global economic growth roughly 0.25 percentage points year−1, comparable to the additional slowing of 0.28 percentage points year−1 projected from future warming. Both current and future losses can theoretically be avoided if populations adapt to fully insulate themselves from the climate—why this has not already occurred everywhere remains a critical open question. For example, clear patterns of adaptation in health impacts and in response to tropical cyclones contrast strongly with limited adaptation in agricultural and macroeconomic responses to temperature. Although some theories suggest these various levels of adaptation ought to be economically optimal, in the sense that costs of additional adaptive actions should exactly balance the benefits of avoided climate-related losses, there is no evidence that allows us to determine how closely observed “adaptation gaps” reflect optimal investments or constrained suboptimal adaptation that should be addressed through policy. OUTLOOK Recent findings provide insight into the historical evolution of the global economy; they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we understand the consequences of future climate changes. Although climate is clearly not the only factor that affects social and economic outcomes, new quantitative measurements reveal that it is a major factor, often with first-order consequences. Research over the coming decade will seek to understand the numerous mechanisms that drive these effects, with the hope that policy may interfere with the most damaging pathways of influence. Both current and future generations will benefit from near-term investigations. “Cracking the code” on when, where, and why adaptation is or is not successful will generate major social benefits today and in the future. In addition, calculations used to design global climate change policies require as input “damage functions” that describe how social and economic losses accrue under different climatic conditions, essential elements that now can (and should) be calibrated to real-world relationships. Designing effective, efficient, and fair policies to manage anthropogenic climate change requires that we possess a quantitative grasp of how different investments today may affect economic and social possibilities in the future. Two globes depict two possible futures for how the climate might change and how those changes are likely to affect humanity, based on recent empirical findings. Base colors are temperature change under “Business as usual” (left, RCP 8.5) and “stringent emissions mitigation” (right, RCP 2.6). Overlaid are composite satellite images of nighttime lights with rescaled intensity reflecting changes in economic productivity in each climate scenario. For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions—such as temperature, rainfall, and violent storms—influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research is illuminating important linkages in the coupled climate-human system. We highlight key methodological innovations and results describing effects of climate on health, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. Because of persistent “adaptation gaps,” current climate conditions continue to play a substantial role in shaping modern society, and future climate changes will likely have additional impact. For example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields by ~48%, warming since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by ~11%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by ~0.28 percentage points per year. In general, we estimate that the economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate changes. Overall, findings from this literature point to climate as an important influence on the historical evolution of the global economy, they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we predict the consequences of future climate changes.</data>

Some research suggests that coyote populations subject to culling have higher pup survival rates, and that male cougars expand their ranges in response to hunting.

      <data key="d3">Patients with liver cirrhosis are advised to limit their sodium consumption to control excessive fluid accumulation. Salt is the most common form in which sodium is consumed daily. Consequently, various recommendations urge patients to limit salt intake. However, there is a lack of consistency regarding salt restriction across the guidelines. Moreover, there is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of salt restriction in the treatment of ascites. Numerous studies have shown that there is no difference in ascites control between patients with restriction of salt intake and those without restriction. Moreover, patients with cirrhosis may have several negative effects from consuming too little salt, although there are no recommendations on the lower limit of salt intake. Sodium is necessary to maintain the extracellular fluid volume; hence, excessive salt restriction can result in volume contraction, which could negatively impact kidney function in a cirrhotic patient. Salt restriction in cirrhotic patients can also compromise nutrient intake, which can have a negative impact on the overall outcome. There is insufficient evidence to recommend restricted salt intake for all patients with cirrhosis, including those with severe hyponatremia. The existing guidelines on salt restriction do not consider the salt sensitivity of patients; their nutritional state, volume status and sodium storage sites; and the risk of hypochloremia. This opinion article aims to critically analyze the existing literature with regard to salt recommendations for patients with liver cirrhosis and identify potential knowledge gaps that call for further research.</data>

      <data key="d3">Small changes to water flow regimes from dams can help to restore river ecosystems The world's rivers are regulated by about 58,000 large dams (more than 15 m high) that provide water supplies for municipalities and irrigation, allow downstream navigation, and enable hydropower production (1). New dams are widely seen as sources of green energy. An estimated 75% of the world's potential hydropower capacity is unexploited (2), and some 3700 new dams are currently proposed in developing economies (3, 4). But dams also cause substantial and often unacknowledged environmental damage. Recent research affords insight into how dams might be strategically operated to partially restore some lost ecosystem functions and services.</data>

      <data key="d3">Zo langzamerhand begint zich in ons land, vooral ook na publikatie van het geschrift no. 103 van de Vereniging voor Belastingwetenschap 1), een zekere literatuur te vormen rond het vraagstuk van de houding van de fiscus tegenover substantialistische winstopvattingen in het bedrijfsleven. Daarbij raakt de ge­ woonte ingeburgerd om de bedrijfseconomen de taak toe te bedelen van propa­ gandisten van het substantialisme tegenover een irrationele fiscale behandeling, terwijl de sociaal-economen dan maar voor de rugdekking moeten zorgen van een aldus belaagde fiscus. Op deze wijze dreigt opnieuw een twistpunt te ontstaan tussen bedrijfseconomie en macro-economie en de redactie van het M.A.B. is dan ook op de voor de hand liggende gedachte gekomen deze discussie nog wat te doen uitdiepen door Prof. dr. J. L. Mey 2) en de ondergetekende, die elkaar al eens onder andere omstandigheden in het strijdperk hebben ontmoet. Nu voelt de laatstgenoemde zich in deze discussie wel enigszins geremd, in de eerste plaats omdat er over de macro-economische gezichtspunten van deze kwestie na de gedegen beschouwing van Mevr. ’t Hooft-Welvaars in „De Naam­ loze Vennootschap” 3) niet zoveel nieuws meer is te zeggen en vervolgens omdat hij in tegenstelling tot collega Mey zijn hoogstandje voor vreemd publiek moet uitvoeren. Publiek dat bovendien laten we het maar eerlijk zeggen niet zo gemakkelijk te overtuigen zal zijn van de kracht van argumenten, die ontleend zijn aan andere sferen dan de zo vertrouwde bedrijfseconomische gedachten­ wereld, waarin vanzelfsprekend het begrip vervangingswaarde met zorgvuldig­ heid wordt gekoesterd. Nu worden juist de bedrijfseconomische aspecten in het navolgende gerelativeerd, omdat zij moeten worden geschikt naast andere ge­ zichtspunten die in de verhouding staat-individu naar voren komen, wanneer het in de belastingheffing gaat om een rechtvaardige, verantwoorde en uitvoer­ bare verdeling van lasten, niet slechts over de individuele bedrijfshuishoudingen maar over alle contribuabelen. Ziet men zich voor een dergelijke taak gesteld, dan is het doorgaans het beste te beginnen met het een en ander toe te geven om zodoende de lezers wat milder te stemmen. Welaan, erkend moet worden dat beschouwingen met substantialis­ tische strekking en daar reken ik wellicht ten ongerieve van J. L. Mey dan ook maar de vervangingswaarde-theorie toe opvoedend hebben gewerkt voor het bedrijfsleven, zowel als het aankomt op prijsbepaling als wanneer het gaat om winstvaststelling. Deze erkenning berust op goeddeels praktische gronden ik baseer mij derhalve niet op de normatief getinte continuïteitsgedachte die b.v. aan de vervangingswaardeleer ten grondslag ligt. Is het bedrijfsleven dus be­ trokken in een educatief proces, dat heilzaam heeft gewerkt, de fiscus doet daar­ aan met name voor zover het duurzame produktiemiddelen betreft niet mee.</data>

 Summary:                                                                                                
     The aesthetics of open spaces in Mahmoud Sami Al-Baroudi’s poetry is an interesting phenomenon, and this phenomenon is formed from the large concentration on open spaces in his poetry.  The place is one of the important elements that contribute and shape the aesthetics of the modern poetic text, and when studying Al-Baroudi’s Diwan, we note that the place was present in multiple aesthetic aspects that the poet employed to express the psychological attitudes and concerns he lived in those places. 
 The study was based on the poet's psychological and emotional relationship with the place, through his description of the aesthetics of open spaces in a poetic language full of descriptions and similes, and suggestive connotations that overflow with poetic meanings.  As well as describing the aesthetics of the village, and the living and silent nature, with all its data of orchards, meadows, green meadows and birds, and with these descriptions he approaches the pre-Islamic poem in his view of the place, as he mentioned the aesthetics of hostile places such as the desert, describing the roads with all their temptations and urging to leave  And travel, which was formed in the poet as a result of his adherence to the psychological repercussions of the place, and his portrayal of the challenges he encounters in the places he passes through, he does what the ancient poets do in describing the fifi and the desert, in a precise poetic language, in an attempt to clarify and draw the aesthetics of open spaces, and to clarify their connotations and aesthetics.

Distance information was thought to be provided by optic flow (OF)—that is, image motion experienced during travel—but this idea was abandoned when stride integration was discovered as an odometer mechanism in ants. We show that ants transported by nest mates are capable of measuring travel distance exclusively by the use of OF cues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the information gained from the optic flowmeter cannot be transferred to the stride integrator. Our results suggest a dual information channel that allows the ants to measure distances by strides and OF cues, although both systems operate independently and in a redundant manner.</data>

      <data key="d1">2017</data>
      <data key="d2">Hnin Ei Thu; Zahid Hussain; Isa Naina Mohamed; Ahmad Nazrun Shuid</data>
      <data key="d3">BACKGROUND
Eurycoma longifolia is a well-documented herbal medicine that has gained widespread recognition due to its versatile pharmacological activities including anticancer, antimalarial, antimicrobial, antioxidant, aphrodisiac, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, anti-diabetic, antirheumatism and anti-ulcer. Plethora of in vitro and in vivo studies evidenced their excellent antiproliferative and anticancer efficacy against various types of human cancers.


OBJECTIVE
This review was aimed to critically analyze the therapeutic viability and anticancer efficacy of Eurycoma longifolia in the treatment of cancer and also to propose its molecular and translational mechanism of cytotoxicity against cancerous cells.


RESULTS
Among a range of medicinally active compounds isolated from various parts (roots, stem, bark and leaves) of Eurycoma longifolia, 16 compounds have shown promising anti-proliferative and anticancer efficacies. Eurycomanone, one of the most active medicinal compounds of Eurycoma longifolia, displayed a strong dose-dependent anticancer efficacy against lung carcinoma (A-549 cells) and breast cancer (MCF-7 cells); however, showed moderate efficacy against gastric (MGC-803 cells) and intestinal carcinomas (HT-29 cells). The prime mode of cytotoxicity of Eurycoma longifolia and its medicinal compounds is the induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) via the up-regulation of the expression of p53 (tumor suppressor protein) and pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) and downregulation of the expression of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2). A remarkable alleviation in the mRNA expression of various cancer-associated biomarkers including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), prohibitin (PHB), annexin-1 (ANX1) and endoplasmic reticulum protein-28 (ERp28) has also been evidenced.


CONCLUSION
Eurycoma longifolia and its medicinal constituents exhibit promising anticancer efficacy and thus can be considered as potential complementary therapy for the treatment of various types of human cancers.</data>

      <data key="d3">
 When the Omicron variant of the COVID–19 virus was identified in November 2021, western states responded by immediately imposing a travel ban on African countries in a bid to keep ‘the African virus’ out of their territories. Seen by some as a necessary step to protect western lives, the travel bans caused a visceral reliving among Africans of colonial-era experiences of shame, humiliation and degradation. We know that actors, during times of crisis, exaggerate identity borders between ‘us’ and ‘them’, and we can understand western reactions to the discovery of Omicron against this theoretical backdrop. What is not clear, however, is why the Omicron travel ban caused such a visceral reliving of a past trauma in the African collective. Supported by a qualitative analysis of news media, this research sets out to explain how travel bans imposed by western nations caused a re-traumatization of the African collective, arguing that narratives surrounding ‘Africa's Omicron virus’ are an extension of the ‘heart of darkness’ ideation that dominated imperial European discourse and practice. Deeper understanding of the many ways in which colonial subjugation persists today, the article argues, can help us better respond to similar future global crises.</data>

      <data key="d3">INTRODUCTION In DNA double helices, hydrogen bonds connect the base pairs across the two strands, and stacking bonds act along the helical axis between neighboring base pairs. Our understanding of DNA and the way it is processed in biology would profit from improved knowledge about the elementary bonds in DNA. Detailed knowledge of the time scales for breaking and forming individual base pairs and base-pair stacks would also help to make more informed decisions in the design of dynamic DNA-based nanoscale devices. RATIONALE The goal of this work is to measure the dynamics of DNA base-pair stacking at the level of individual base-pair steps. Because stacking interactions act perpendicularly to the hydrogen bonds, it should be possible to use mechanical forces to break stacking while leaving hydrogen bonds intact. To realize such measurements, we combine the positioning capabilities of DNA origami with single-molecule manipulation, as enabled by dual-beam optical traps. To make the weak single–base-pair stacking interactions experimentally accessible, we prepared parallel arrays of blunt-end DNA double helices to take advantage of avidity effects when these arrays form stacking interactions (see the figure). Our design allowed controlling the number and the sequences of the base-pair stacks. Noise-suppressing by stiff DNA origami beams connected by a flexible polymer tether enabled the repeated detection of unbinding and rebinding of stacking contacts at low forces (down to 2 piconewtons) with high time resolution (up to 1 kHz). RESULTS We sampled all 16 sequence combinations of installing a particular interfacial base pair on the array on the left beam and another base pair in the array on the right beam, and we created arrays with two, four, and six blunt ends. We could measure the force-dependent lifetimes for all base-pair step sequence combinations in the presence of 20 mM MgCl2, which is a condition typically used in DNA nanotechnology. For a subset of base-pair step combinations, we also obtained data in the presence of 500 mM NaCl, which mimics the conditions in the cell nucleus. The base-pair stack arrays spontaneously dissociated at average rates ranging from 0.02 to 500 per second, where the dissociation time scale strongly depended on the sequence combination and the stack array size. For a given sequence combination, larger array sizes always had larger lifetimes, as expected from avidity. Another key feature revealed in the lifetime data was the low sensitivity of the stacking interactions on the extent of pulling force. This phenomenon reflects short-ranged interaction potentials. Concerning rebinding of the stack arrays, we found that the rebinding kinetics depended much more strongly on the applied force, which may be understood by considering that rebinding of the stacks requires a thermally activated contraction of the flexible tether—which was the same for all variants—against an opposing force tether contraction. However, the rebinding kinetics was independent, within experimental error, of the base-pair step sequence combination and the size of the array under study. We used a model to estimate the free-energy increments per single base-pair stack from the kinetic rates that we measured with stack arrays. The free-energy increments per stack ranged from –0.8 to –3.4 kilocalories per mole. Our data reveals a trend in the stacking-strength hierarchy that may be associated with the extent of geometrical atomic overlap between the bases within a base-pair step. CONCLUSION Our data provides a quantitative basis for the rational design of dynamic DNA-based nanoscale machines and assemblies. Nanoengineers can directly read off the expected lifetimes of stack arrays for all sequence combinations and for various array sizes and at salt conditions that are commonly used in the field. With this data, design solutions for transition kinetics may be generated that cover several orders of magnitudes in lifetime, from milliseconds to several seconds. The sequence-resolved information obtained in our experiments may inform kinetic models of DNA hybridization and may help in adjusting force fields to perform more realistic molecular dynamics simulations. More generally, our experimental methods advance the capabilities of single-molecule mechanical experiments. Using the tethered-beam system, target molecules may be placed and exposed in controlled orientations and stoichiometry so as to study the weak forces occurring between them in solution. A variety of interactions between various kinds of molecules may be studied in the future due to the modularity and the addressability of the DNA origami–based tethered-beam system. How strong is DNA base-pair stacking? Schematic illustration of the experimental system that we developed to measure the strength of base-pair stacking on the level of single particles. The system consists of two tethered DNA origami beams that feature parallel arrays of blunt-end DNA double helices. The beams may be attached to two micrometer-sized beads for manipulation in a dual-beam optical trap. With this system, we could measure lifetimes at which DNA base-pair stacks spontaneously dissociate as a function of force applied in the helical direction. We directly measured at the single-molecule level the forces and lifetimes of DNA base-pair stacking interactions for all stack sequence combinations. Our experimental approach combined dual-beam optical tweezers with DNA origami components to allow positioning of blunt-end DNA helices so that the weak stacking force could be isolated. Base-pair stack arrays that lacked a covalent backbone connection spontaneously dissociated at average rates ranging from 0.02 to 500 per second, depending on the sequence combination and stack array size. Forces in the range from 2 to 8 piconewtons that act along the helical direction only mildly accelerated the stochastic unstacking process. The free-energy increments per stack that we estimate from the measured forward and backward kinetic rates ranged from –0.8 to –3.4 kilocalories per mole, depending on the sequence combination. Our data contributes to understanding the mechanics of DNA processing in biology, and it is helpful for designing the kinetics of DNA-based nanoscale devices according to user specifications.</data>

The observations indicate that near-to-intermediate-field dynamic triggering commonly exists and fundamentally promotes aftershock occurrence. The mainshocks and their nearby early aftershocks are located at major subduction zones and continental boundaries, and mainshocks with all types of faulting-mechanisms (normal, reverse, and strike-slip) can trigger early aftershocks.</data>

Using estimates of Internet penetration obtained through network measurements, we show that politically excluded groups suffer from significantly lower Internet penetration rates compared with those in power, an effect that cannot be explained by economic or geographic factors. Our findings underline one of the central impediments to “liberation technology,” which is that governments still play a key role in the allocation of the Internet and can, intentionally or not, sabotage its liberating effects.</data>

      <data key="d3">Particle breakage in soils is a well-recognised behaviour. Conventional methods for quantifying the breakage process rely on calculating the area between the particle size distribution (PSD) curves produced before and after crushing. A key aspect of breakage is understanding the process across the different size/sieve fractions. Grading entropy coordinates allow for the representation of any PSD to be shown as a single point on a Cartesian plane and are able to track grading evolution with relative ease. In this study, grading entropy coordinates are compared to three commonly used breakage indices (Br, Br* and IG). It is shown that grading entropy coordinates are advantageous over the traditional indices in quantifying subtle changes in the PSD evolution and directly provide further insight with regards to the individual fraction sizes. It is also discussed that conventional breakage indices rely on relative measures and are dependent on assumptions of an initial and/or final PSD. In contrast, grading entropy coordinates depend only on the characteristics of the (current) PSD curve. It was also observed that the breakage evolution captured by the entropy coordinates is able to determine the rate at which differently sized particles break as differently sized particles take on stress. Moreover, it is suggested that entropy coordinates may also stress path dependency, a feature not present in conventional indices.</data>

      <data key="d3">Through the exploratory analysis, this research note examines how companies in the nautical industry in Brittany perceive and evaluate the incentives proposed by public authorities to dynamize their territory. To this end it uses qualitative interviews with a coding and analysis phase. It formulates some hypothesis and through the use of a questionnaire, a quantitative study was made of a larger sample of companies in the nautical industry. The results show that companies generally vote for cluster strategies, and indirect incentives but seem to be rather hostile to direct economic aid. It also appears that the multiplication of decision-making levels in the implementation of public policies is seen as a hindrance to efficiency. All companies do not however perceive the policies in the same way. A typology of business is proposed. There are collaborators, sceptics, and opportunists companies. This result shows the complexity of the evaluation of public policies for entrepreneurship, because each group will use the incentives for the promotion of the territories in a differentiated way.</data>

      <data key="d2">Ryoko Araki; Ye Mu; Hilary McMillan</data>
      <data key="d3">ABSTRACT We evaluated the Global Land Data Assimilation System surface soil moisture product (GLDAS v. 2.1) against in situ soil moisture networks in arid climates in Australia and the United States, using common statistical metrics and seasonality metrics. Our results showed that GLDAS performed well (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.100 m3/m3; unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) = 0.060 m3/m3; correlation coefficient (R) = 0.555 on average) but systematically overestimated the soil moisture values (Bias = 0.067 m3/m3). The performance was better in Australian Oznet and the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN), compared to the US Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) network. In terms of seasonality, GLDAS soil moisture seasons were biased to start earlier; on average, drying and wetting transitions started 28 and 16 days earlier than in situ data, respectively. The end dates of GLDAS seasonal transitions showed good agreement with in situ data; the errors in transition timings were limited to within a week. This tendency is stronger in the US networks compared to the Australian network.</data>

      <data key="d2">Shubhadeep Mukherjee; Pradip Kumar Bala</data>
      <data key="d3">Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this paper is to study sarcasm in online text – specifically on twitter – to better understand customer opinions about social issues, products, services, etc. This can be immensely helpful in reducing incorrect classification of consumer sentiment toward issues, products and services. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
In this study, 5,000 tweets were downloaded and analyzed. Relevant features were extracted and supervised learning algorithms were applied to identify the best differentiating features between a sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentence. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results using two different classification algorithms, namely, Naive Bayes and maximum entropy show that function words and content words together are most effective in identifying sarcasm in tweets. The most differentiating features between a sarcastic and a non-sarcastic tweet were identified. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Understanding the use of sarcasm in tweets let companies do better sentiment analysis and product recommendations for users. This could help businesses attract new customers and retain the old ones resulting in better customer management. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This paper uses novel features to identify sarcasm in online text which is one of the most challenging problems in natural language processing. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study on sarcasm detection from a customer management perspective.</data>

      <data key="d3">The study explored grade 12 students' understanding of reaction kinetics, a topic which has not been extensively explored in the chemistry education literature at this level. A 3-tier diagnostic instrument with 11 questions was developed – this format is of very recent origin and has been the subject of only a handful of studies. The findings reveal that reaction kinetics is not an easy topic for the students to understand. A total of 23 alternative conceptions (ACs) as well as some indication of their strengths and other confidence-related measures have been documented for the students (N = 137) – most of these ACs have not been reported before. When the overall scores of the students in the diagnostic test are ranked, it was found that there are a number of differences in the ACs held by students in the upper and lower 25% of the sample. While most of the ACs held by these groups are common to the overall sample, a number of these are not found in the overall sample. The findings further underscore the diagnostic utility of the 3-tier format. Some implications of the findings are discussed.</data>

      <data key="d3">Despite recent reforms, world agricultural markets remain highly distorted by government policies. Traditional indicators of agricultural and food price distortions such as producer and consumer support estimates (PSEs and CSEs) can be poor guides to the policies’ trade effects. Two recent studies provide much better indicators of trade (and welfare)-reducing effects of farm price and trade policies, but they provide somewhat differing numbers. This article explains why those estimates differ and how they might be improved for use in ongoing annual monitoring of the trade restrictiveness of agricultural policies in both high-income and developing countries.</data>

      <data key="d3">Highly siderophile elements (HSEs) are strongly depleted in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) but are present in near-chondritic relative abundances. The conventional explanation is that the HSEs were stripped from the mantle by the segregation of metal during core formation but were added back in near-chondritic proportions by late accretion, after core formation had ceased. Here we show that metal-silicate equilibration and segregation during Earth’s core formation actually increased HSE mantle concentrations because HSE partition coefficients are relatively low at the high pressures of core formation within Earth. The pervasive exsolution and segregation of iron sulfide liquid from silicate liquid (the “Hadean matte”) stripped magma oceans of HSEs during cooling and crystallization, before late accretion, and resulted in slightly suprachondritic palladium/iridium and ruthenium/iridium ratios.</data>

      <data key="d3">A key aspect of bacterial survival is the ability to evolve while migrating across spatially varying environmental challenges. Laboratory experiments, however, often study evolution in well-mixed systems. Here, we introduce an experimental device, the microbial evolution and growth arena (MEGA)–plate, in which bacteria spread and evolved on a large antibiotic landscape (120 × 60 centimeters) that allowed visual observation of mutation and selection in a migrating bacterial front. While resistance increased consistently, multiple coexisting lineages diversified both phenotypically and genotypically. Analyzing mutants at and behind the propagating front, we found that evolution is not always led by the most resistant mutants; highly resistant mutants may be trapped behind more sensitive lineages. The MEGA-plate provides a versatile platform for studying microbial adaption and directly visualizing evolutionary dynamics.</data>

      <data key="d3">The present study was aimed to look at the impacts of illumination time and illumination color on outgrowth and activity of Nil Tilapia (Tilapia Niloticus). A commercial food was used for feeding fish during experimental period. The data obtained from the experiment were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (using SPSS program). The results indicated that illumination time (24, 16 hour and control) and illumination colors (white, red and blue) were significantly affected on fish activity. The fish outgrowth at illumination blue was higher than other illumination colors for all illumination time. The illumination blue and long illumination time (24 light hours) created the top fish percentage weight gained during feeding period (WGDFP = 52.9 g), specific growth rate (SGR = 4.08 %), daily growth rate (DGR = 17.63 %) and growth efficiency (GE = 29 %). On the other side, the blue illumination and short illumination time 16 h created weight gained during feeding period (WGDFP = 46.5 g), specific growth rate (SGR = 3.89 %), daily growth rate (DGR = 15.51 %) and growth efficiency (GE = 28 %). At long illumination time, the feed conversation efficiency (FCE) was 92, 95 and 98 % at illumination white, red and blue respectively. There were significant differences in crude protein and crude fat contents among fish exposed to different photoperiod regimes. Fish exposed to (24 h) illumination regime had significantly lower crude fat and ash than those of the other.</data>

      <data key="d3">Electron holography is used to map out the wave function of a photo-emitted electron Since the birth of quantum mechanics, scientists have been dreaming of imaging, and possibly controlling, the motion of electrons in atoms and molecules. These electrons are described in the quantum theory by wave functions. However, the wave function is an elusive quantity: It is a complex function with an amplitude and phase, but its square modulus is usually the only quantity directly measurable in experiments. In addition, visualizing the electron dynamics requires extremely high temporal resolution, on the order of attoseconds (1 as = 10−18 s). On page 1150 of this issue, Villeneuve et al. (1) report on an elegant experiment that demonstrates the possibility of fully reconstructing the electron wave function in the photoionization of neon and thus paving the way for coherent control of the process.</data>

      <data key="d3">In the last 10 years, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles have confounded scientists. The normal role of these bundles of protein and fat is to ferry cholesterol from the rest of the body to the liver, which eliminates it from the body. More of something good should mean better health, and people who naturally have higher HDL levels are usually better off. But drugs that increase HDL cholesterol have flopped in clinical trials, and genes that help raise it don9t seem to track with less heart disease. Now, a new study that included a subgroup of people with high HDL suggests that it can sometimes be a signal not of heart health, but of the opposite: a cholesterol system unable to siphon the fatty particles from circulation.</data>

      <data key="d1">2022</data>
      <data key="d2">Maja Šrut</data>
      <data key="d3">One of the major emerging concerns within ecotoxicology is the effect of environmental pollutants on epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression, meaning that the alterations of epigenetic marks can induce long-term physiological effects that can even be inherited across generations. Many invertebrate species have been used as models in environmental epigenetics, with a special focus on DNA methylation changes caused by environmental perturbations (e.g., pollution). Among soil organisms, earthworms are considered the most relevant sentinel organisms for anthropogenic stress assessment and are widely used as standard models in ecotoxicological testing of soil toxicity. In the last decade, several research groups have focused on assessing the impact of environmental stress on earthworm epigenetic mechanisms and tried to link these mechanisms to the physiological effects. The aim of this review is to give an overview and to critically examine the available literature covering this topic. The high level of earthworm genome methylation for an invertebrate species, responsiveness of epigenome to environmental stimuli, availability of molecular resources, and the possibility to study epigenetic inheritance make earthworms adequate models in environmental epigenomics. However, there are still many knowledge gaps that need to be filled in, before we can fully explore earthworms as models in this field. These include detailed characterization of the methylome using next-generation sequencing tools, exploration of multigenerational and transgenerational effects of pollutants, and information about other epigenetic mechanisms apart from DNA methylation. Moreover, the connection between epigenetic effects and phenotype has to be further explored.</data>

      <data key="d3">ABSTRACT This article offers new insight into students’ responses to Womens’ and Gender Studies (WGS) classes by overcoming the self-selection bias hitherto inherent in the field. Exploring the experiences of 1406 students (770 women, 636 men) of a university with a WGS requirement across all study programmes, we examine the prevailing discourses on WGS, participants’ (dis)agreement as well as personal and professional benefits gained through WGS. Additionally, we evaluate the perceived value of WGS for themselves, in society, and of WGS opportunities in higher education. Findings reveal a gender bias regarding discourses, experience, benefit, and value, with 70.1% women and 32.4% men supporting the idea of WGS as a mandatory subject. Women’s support indicates a need for tools to negotiate gender issues, while men’s resistance serves to defend male privileges. We conclude that a requirement of WGS classes amplifies the potential for both – resistance and change.</data>

The chance of dying from breast cancer increases dramatically as the world’s population continues to increase at an alarming rate. Compared to other cancers discovered thus far, breast cancer is the second most severe. In addition to assisting medical staff in disease diagnosis, an automated disease detection system also provides reliable, effective, and fast intervention, which reduces the likelihood of mortality. In this research study, the Artificial Neural Network is employed for breast cancer classification. The model is validated on well-known dataset comprised from UCI machine learning repository. The results reveal that the ANNs obtained the highest accuracy i.e. 98.24%. Keywords: Machine Learning, Neural Network, Algorithm, Artificial Intelligence.</data>

      <data key="d0">A neurodevelopmental approach to myotonic dystrophy type 1</data>
      <data key="d1">2019</data>
      <data key="d2">Nathalie Angeard</data>
      <data key="d3">Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease that affects multiple organs (e.g. heart, eyes, endocrine system, brain). Five phenotypes have been described, ranging from a mild form with later onset to a congenital form with moderate to severe intellectual disability. The current consensus is that DM1 is a brain disorder with a wide spectrum of neurocognitive impairments. Recent findings in adult presentations documented cognitive, executive, and memory or language deterioration, suggesting a neurodegenerative process. Previous (but scarce) studies also documented a decline in global IQ in some individuals with the congenital or childhood phenotype, but no data was collected regarding the progression of cognitive deficits during childhood or adolescence. To our knowledge, Lindeblad et al. have conducted the first prospective study focusing on this very central question of cognition and DM1. They investigated global cognitive abilities (IQ) and adaptive functioning in 51 participants with the severe or mild congenital phenotype and childhood onset-form of DM1 over a 7-year followup. On initial evaluation, children with DM1 scored below normative data both for adaptive and cognitive skills (&gt;80% with intellectual disability). This difference did not change significantly on follow-up, suggesting a persistent developmental delay along a progressing developmental trajectory, rather than an emerging developmental deficit or a cognitive deterioration. Evolution of individual scores over time showed significant improvements in communication, socialization, and daily living skills in the childhood group but no change in the other groups (except for communication in the severe congenital subgroup). This study is of great interest for several reasons. First, the authors studied the developmental aspect of DM1 closely and examined children over a wide age range with a 7-year interval between the two assessments. They did not mention any a priori developmental hypothesis, but this methodological approach will provide a useful framework for researchers investigating performance in other cognitive domains. According to the neuroconstructivist approach, the challenge will be to track dynamic trajectories over developmental time (i.e. tracing cognitive functions back to their basic level and then probing their progression). Second, a subgroup of 11 individuals with DM1 (n=8 with childhood-onset) exhibited a normal IQ or mild intellectual disability at the 7-year follow-up (but data was missing concerning the homogeneity of verbal or perceptive reasoning skills and their change over time). Taken together, these results reopen the question of a continuum between congenital and childhood neurocognitive impairments: is congenital DM1 characterized by a continuous delayed onset and slow rate pattern, and childhood onset-forms by a slow rate? These results confirm the need to longitudinally evaluate cognitive and adaptive deficits in domains such as social cognition and executive components. They also call for particular attention to early neurodevelopmental symptoms, even before the occurrence of neuromuscular signs. The present findings highlight the importance of providing support tailored to the developmental trajectories seen in each phenotype. Earlier screening for these abilities may lead to earlier and better targeted intervention, including social skills remediation.</data>

      <data key="d3">V. Solovyov’s philosophy appeared in the post-reform Russia when the social structure of the country was subject to important changes caused by the impact of a rapid growth of capitalism. The elements of the old serfdom and feudal structure, on the other hand, were still offering resistance to the development of capitalist forms of society. The Russian intellectuals of that time were seriously anxious about the future history of their homeland. That problem was being solved by presenting a variety of models to remake the existing social structure of Russia. V. Solovyov undertook the task of overcoming the social contradictions of his society through a “renovated” Christian consciousness. It was this “renovation” suggested by V. Solovyov that served as a basis for his philosophy of “All-unity” which, in its turn, is considered to be a mystical-philosophical model of an ideal society free of class struggle and other social contradictions, i.e., an antipode of capitalism. The author of the present article shows the "All-unity" conception to be deeply reactionary at that historical situation.</data>

      <data key="d3">Abstract One of the effective ways for increasing milk intake in a diet is producing flavored milk. In the present study, flavored persimmon milk drinks were formulated and produced. Rheological, sensorial, and physicochemical properties of the drinks were evaluated. Different amounts of persimmon (5, 10, 20, and 30% W/V), gum Arabic (0.1 and 0.2% W/V), and sugar (3 and 5% W/V) were used to produce persimmon milk. All the experiments were done in a completely randomized design (CRD) in three replicates. First, persimmons were mixed thoroughly in a blender then, according to the formulation, whole milk was added to it and mixed again. The obtained mixture was heated up to 50 ᵒC then sugar and the gum were added and mixed completely for 3 min. The drink was pasteurized at 90 ᵒC for 1 min. Sensorial analysis revealed that the most acceptable persimmon milk was related to 0.1% gum Arabic, 5% sugar, and 10% persimmon. Flow behavior of the drinks with 20 and 30% persimmon was Non‐Newtonian, while 10% persimmon samples with and without gum showed Newtonian behavior. The drinks with 20 and 30% persimmon were pseudoplastic, and their apparent viscosity increased by increasing shear rates. By applying a proper content of persimmon in milk, we can produce a nutritious flavored milk drink with acceptable taste, stability, and consistency. As this drink has high nutrient contents like phenol, dietary fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, etc., it can help promote health, especially for children.</data>

      <data key="d3">Oil used for deep-frying is often left to stand after cooking. A major concern is oxidation during standing that might be avoidable, especially in the case of oil used repeatedly for commercial deep-frying as this involves large volumes that are difficult to cool in a conventional fryer. This paper describes a method to minimize oil oxidation. French fries were deep-fried and the oil temperature decreased in a manner typical for a commercial deep-fryer. The concentration of polar compounds generated from thermally oxidized oil remarkably increased at temperature higher than 100°C but little oxidation occurred below 60°C. Heating the oil showed that the peroxide and polar compound content did not increase when the oil was actively cooled using a running water-cooled Graham-type condenser system to cool the oil from 180°C to room temperature within 30 min. When French fries were fried and the oil was then immediately cooled using the condenser, the polar compound content during cooling did not increase. Our results demonstrate that active cooling of heated oil is simple and quite effective for inhibiting oxidation.</data>

      <data key="d3">One permanent characteristic of the thermodynamics of small systems is environment-dependence, also known as ensemble-dependence. Fluid molecules in soft (deformable) nano-confinement offer a special ensemble that acts as a bridge between classical isobaric (NPT) and isochoric (NVT) ensembles. Here, we discuss the gas–liquid transition taking place in a soft nano-confinement where the cell volume is not fixed but changes when the system pressure is changed. The free energy of the system is calculated as a function of the size of the liquid droplet that appears in the gas phase. We discuss how the phase behavior changes when the condition of the confinement changes from rigid confinement to very soft confinement. For the simple fluid model studied, the coexistence and critical phase behaviors are found to be uniquely determined by αK (αK is the dimensionless elasticity constant of the wall of confined space and is proportional to its ability to resist deformation), and the confinement with moderate softness exhibits richer phase behavior. We then study the fluctuations of pressure, volume, and droplet size for fluid in soft confined spaces, which is again closely related to the wall softness. Under moderate softness, large fluctuations in both fluid pressure and volume are seen in the transition region where fluid pressure increases with volume expansion, accompanied by the strengthened fluctuation of droplet size.</data>

      <data key="d3">We report our ongoing search for extremely inverted spectrum compact radio galaxies, for which the defining feature in the radio spectrum is not the spectral peak, but instead the slope of the spectrum (alpha) in the high-opacity (i.e., lower frequency) part of the radio spectrum. Specifically, our focus is on the spectral regime with spectral index, alpha&gt;+2.5. The motivation for our study is, firstly, extragalactic sources with such extreme spectral index are extremely rare, because of the unavailability of right combination of sensitivity and resolution over a range of low frequencies. The second reason is more physically motivated, since alpha = +2.5 is the maximum slope theoretically possible for a standard radio source emitting synchrotron radiation. Therefore such sources could be the test-bed for some already proposed alternative scenarios for synchrotron self-absorption (SSA), like the free-free absorption (FFA) highlighting the importance of jet-ISM interaction in the radio galaxy evolution.</data>

      <data key="d3">When a gel absorbs solvent from surrounding, stress field is created in the gel, and this causes complex dynamics of the swelling behavior. Here we study this effect for disk-shaped gel by rigorously solving the diffusio-mechanical coupling equation. We show that (a) while the macroscopic thickness and the radius of the gel increases monotonically in time, the gel is compressed near the mid-plane, and that (b) while the swelling time depends on the shear modulus $G$ of the gel, its dependence is weak, and the time is mainly determined by the friction constant of the gel network and the osmotic bulk modulus of the gel. We also show that these characteristic features are reproduced accurately by a simple variational calculation for the gel deformation. An analytical expression is given for the swelling time.</data>

      <data key="d3">This study aims to analyse human bones exposed to low/medium temperatures (200–650°C) under experimentally controlled conditions, both oxidizing and reducing, using complementary optical and neutron vibrational spectroscopy techniques. Clear differences were observed between the aerobically and anaerobically heated bones. The organic constituents disappeared at lower temperatures for the former (ca 300°C), while they lingered for higher temperatures in anaerobic environments (ca 450–550°C). Unsaturated non-graphitizing carbon species (chars) were detected mainly for anaerobically heated samples, and cyanamide formation occurred only at 650°C in reducing settings. Overall, the main changes were observed from 300 to 400°C in anaerobic conditions and from 450 to 500°C in aerobic environments. The present results enabled the identification of specific spectroscopic biomarkers of the effect of moderate temperatures (less than or equal to 650°C) on human bone, thus contributing to a better characterization of forensic and archaeological skeletal remains subject to heating under distinct environmental settings. In particular, these data may provide information regarding cannibalism or ancient bone boiling and defleshing rituals.</data>

      <data key="d3">Sex chromosomes are unique genomic regions with sex-specific or sex-biased inherent patterns and are expected to be more frequently subject to sex-specific selection. Substantial knowledge on the evolutionary patterns of sex-linked genes have been gained from the studies on the male heterogametic systems (XY male, XX female), but the understanding of the role of sex-specific selection in the evolution of female-heterogametic sex chromosomes (ZW female, ZZ male) is limited. Here we collect the W-linked genes of 27 birds, covering the three major avian clades: Neoaves (songbirds), Galloanserae (chicken), and Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous). We find that the avian W chromosomes exhibit very conserved gene content despite their independent evolution of recombination suppression. The retained W-linked genes have higher dosage-sensitive and higher expression level than the lost genes, suggesting the role of purifying selection in their retention. Moreover, they are not enriched in ancestrally female-biased genes, and have not acquired new ovary-biased expression patterns after becoming W-linked. They are broadly expressed across female tissues, and the expression profile of the W-linked genes in females is not deviated from that of the homologous Z-linked genes. Together, our new analyses suggest that female-specific positive selection on the avian W chromosomes is limited, and the gene content of the W chromosomes is mainly shaped by purifying selection.</data>

      <data key="d3">In this study, we adopted parenting styles as a multidimensional and latent construct that includes different aspects of parenting, rather than solely focusing on a single parenting style. In a Web-based survey with 1203 Greek parents, we identified parenting styles and their SDQ reports on their children. According to our results by Latent Profile Analysis, we must use a more complex approach concerning parenting styles. We identified a “Highly Authoritative style” profile with high levels of authoritative, low levels of authoritarian and middle levels of permissive parenting styles. We additionally identified a profile called “Relaxed Authoritative style”, with still high but lower levels of authoritative style, low but slightly heightened levels of authoritarian style, and middle levels of permissive style. A further profile, named “Permissive Focused Authoritative style”, had a mix of high levels of authoritative, moderate levels of permissive, and elevated levels of authoritarian parenting styles. Finally, in a profile named “Inconsistent Parenting style”, we identified parents with a blend of still high, but the lowest of all four levels of authoritative and highest levels of permissive and authoritarian parenting styles. When combining the four identified parenting patterns with the SDQ results, we identified the “highly authoritative parenting style” profile to be the least connected to internalizing or externalizing problems of the respective children.</data>

      <data key="d3">In this paper, we target the problems of finding a global minimum of nonlinear and stochastic programming problems. To solve this type of problem, we propose new approaches based on combining direct search methods with Evolution Strategies (ESs) and Scatter Search (SS) metaheuristics approaches. First, we suggest new designs of ESs and SS with a memory-based element called Gene Matrix (GM) to deal with those type of problems. These methods are called Directed Evolution Strategies (DES) and Directed Scatter Search (DSS), respectively, and they are able to search for a global minima. Moreover, a faster convergence can be achieved by accelerating the evolutionary search process using GM, and in the final stage we apply the Nelder-Mead algorithm to find the global minimum from the solutions found so far. Then, the variable-sample method is invoked in the DES and DSS to compose new stochastic programming techniques. Extensive numerical experiments have been applied on some well-known functions to test the performance of the proposed methods.</data>

According to recent studies, the calculated band structure should represent a zero-gap semiconductor at 1 bar that is similar to α-ET2I3 under high pressure (&gt;15 kbar). Such materials have attracted extensive interest because the electrons at the Fermi level can be massless Dirac fermions (MDFs), with relativistic behaviors like those seen in graphene. In fact, α-STF2I3 exhibited nearly temperature-independent resistivity, ρ, (~100–300 K), a phenomenon that is widely observed in zero-gap semiconductors. The non-Arrhenius-type increase in ρ (&lt;~100 K) was consistent with the characteristics of interacting MDFs. The paramagnetic susceptibility, χ, (2–300 K)—as well as the reflectivity, R and optical conductivity, σ, (25–300 K; 400–25,000 cm−1)—were also almost temperature independent. Furthermore, σ was practically independent of wavenumber at ~6000–15,000 cm−1. There was no structural transition based on X-ray studies (90–300 K). Considering all the electrical, magnetic, optical and structural properties of α-STF2I3 at 1 bar, it was concluded that the salt possesses a band structure characterized with Dirac cones, which was consistent with the calculation.</data>

These structurally dynamic RNA shapeshifters present a challenging RNA folding problem, because the RNA sequence adopts multiple structures and may sometimes contain regions of partial disorder. Recent advances in high resolution asymmetric cryoelectron microscopy and chemical probing provide new ways to probe the degree of structure and disorder, and have identified more than one conformation in dynamic equilibrium in viral RNA. Chemical probing and the Detection of RNA Folding Ensembles using Expectation Maximization (DREEM) algorithm has been applied to studies of the dynamic equilibrium conformations in HIV RNA in vitro, in virio, and in vivo.

As part of this research, the Fuzzy based Flexible Energy Efficient Routing protocol (FIE2R) will be presented as a routing system for WANET. The decision maker is in charge of the whole FIE2R procedure, which is separated into two parts. It is the WANET graph start phase, which aids in the second phase's determination of each route's reward. That's from a comprehensive computation of FIE2R using MATLAB and NS2 and a comparative analysis of the same with other networking schemes, the recommended protocol improves performance in terms of energy consumption.

Though our current extinction crisis is substantial, it pales in comparison to the largest extinction in Earth's history, which occurred at the end of the Permian Period. Referred to as the “Great Dying,” this event saw the loss of up to 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial species. Penn et al. explored the extinction dynamics of the time using Earth system models in conjunction with physiological data across animal taxa (see the Perspective by Kump). They conclude that increased marine temperatures and reduced oxygen availability were responsible for a majority of the recorded extinctions. Because similar environmental alterations are predicted outcomes of current climate change, we would be wise to take note.

Two-dimensional materials with a hexagonal lattice, such as graphene, have two distinct “valleys” in their band structure.

Li et al. created chiral valley Hall states on the boundary between oppositely gated regions of bilayer graphene. They then guided these so-called kink states through their sample using spatially modulated gating, demonstrating right and left turns, as well as a valley valve function.

These fundamental bounds can be revealed in low-dimensional constrictions defining a single transport channel. The discrete unit (quantum) of electrical conductance G0 has been observed in many experiments dating back to 1988 (1, 2), but the quantum of thermal conductance G0,Th has been much more challenging to probe. Unlike tiny electrical currents, it is much harder to measure minute heat currents in a reproducible manner. On page 1192 of this issue, Cui et al. (3) conquer this challenge by developing an experimental platform for studying quantum thermal transport at the atomic limit. Their work reveals that thermal conductance can be quantized even at room temperature, as well as the fundamental relation between the thermal and electrical conductances. This study paves the way for investigations of thermal phenomena in individual molecular devices, with technological ramifications for controlling energy transport in nanoscale electronic circuitry.</data>

Charge carriers move through semiconductor polymers by hopping transport. In principle, these polymers should be more conductive at higher temperatures. In practice, conductivity drops at high temperatures because interchain contacts are disrupted, which limits potential applications. Gumyusenge et al. now show that appropriate blending of a semicrystalline conjugated polymer with an insulating polymer that has a high glass-transition temperature creates a morphology that stabilizes a network of semiconductor channels. High charge conductivity was maintained in these materials up to 220°C.

      <data key="d3">Cleavage of extracellular DNA NETs is essential for inhibiting peripheral organ failure During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼1011 neutrophils daily (1)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (2, 3). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (4). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (5). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (6) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (7). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcázar et al. (8) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</data>

All Oxz rings were substituted with Thz in cyclo(–Ile–Thz–D‐Val–Thz–)2 (5). These analogues had new Oxz and Thz blocks forming the 24‐membered ring. Based on CD spectra and X‐ray diffraction analyses, the structures of all four analogues were classified as square ASC forms. But the structures of 2 and 5 differed from the original square form of 1, and they showed no cytotoxicity. The structure of 3 was very similar to that of 1, and 3 showed 10 times greater cytotoxicity than 1. Although no definite structure of 4 was obtained, it showed three times greater cytotoxicity than 1. It appears that the position and number of Oxz residues are essential determinants in the structure‐cytotoxicity relationship of ASC analogues.</data>

Classical nucleation theory predicts that two-dimensional islands on a surface must reach a critical size before they continue to grow; below that size, they dissolve. Chen et al. used phage display to select for short peptides that would bind to molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) (see the Perspective by Kahr and Ward). Hexagonal arrays of these peptides grew epitaxially as dimers but without a size barrier—the critical nuclei size was zero. Although two-dimensional arrays formed, growth occurred one row at time. Classical nucleation theory indeed predicts the absence of a barrier for such one-dimensional growth.

In bacteria, energy production by the electron transport chain occurs at cell membranes and can be influenced by the lipid composition of the membrane. Budin et al. used genetic engineering to influence the concentration of unsaturated branched-chain fatty acids and thus control membrane viscosity (see the Perspective by Schon). Experimental measurements and mathematical modeling indicated that rates of respiratory metabolism and rates of cell growth were dependent on membrane viscosity and its effects on diffusion. Experiments on yeast mitochondria also showed similar effects. Maintaining efficient respiration may thus place evolutionary constraints on cellular lipid composition.

The scaffold protein p62 has a critical role in autophagy, the regulated intracellular degradation of proteins and organelles. Sanchez-Garrido et al. identified a proteolytic fragment of human p62, called p62TRM, that had a distinct function from full-length p62 (see the Focus by Martens). Instead of promoting autophagy, p62TRM regulated responses to nutrient availability. This function was lost in p62 variants with disease-associated mutations in the cleavage site, suggesting that defective nutrient sensing may account for some of the symptoms of patients with p62 mutations.

The protein LZTR1 is mutated in human cancers and developmental diseases.

Steklov et al. showed that mice haploinsufficient for LZTR1 recapitulated aspects of the human disease Noonan syndrome. Their biochemical studies showed that LZTR1 associated with RAS. LZTR1 appears to function as an adaptor that promotes ubiquitination of RAS, thus inhibiting its signaling functions. Bigenzahn et al. found LZTR1 in a screen for proteins whose absence led to resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat cancers caused by the BCR-ABL oncogene product. Their biochemical studies and genetic studies in fruitflies also showed that loss of LZTR1 led to increased activity of RAS and signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

      <data key="d1">2018</data>
      <data key="d2">Lara Agostini; Douglas Wegner</data>
      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The importance of government policies in the formation and development of strategic networks has been widely recognized. Many countries have designed specific government policies with the aim to support network creation. However, the influence of these different government policies on the development process of strategic networks has never been considered so far. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how different government policies influence the development process of strategic networks.


Design/methodology/approach
This research uses a multiple case study design with a descriptive and processual case study approach. The study compares two strategic networks where different government policies have been implemented: on the one hand, policies aimed to promote networking through the support of trade association and the design of specific laws; on the other hand, public policies providing financial support for network development.


Findings
The comparative analysis of two networks shows how the different activities along the development process are carried out based on the different support received, and it highlights that financing network creation and exerting a control function is not enough to stimulate network development and sustain its success.


Research limitations/implications
Considering the limited generalizability of this exploratory study because of the analysis of two cases, future studies with a larger number of strategic networks can expand the understanding of the effects of different types of public support for network development.


Practical implications
The results contribute to make entrepreneurs and public bodies aware of the importance of a managerial support to strategic networks’ development. The authors provide a series of evidences to academics and practitioners regarding how the development process of strategic networks may be shaped depending on the different government support they receive.


Originality/value
The value of this contribution lies in demonstrating the influence of different government policies in the development process of strategic networks, which has not been investigated yet, despite the great attention governments are devoting to networking.

      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The concept of positional innovation – as one of the four innovation types of the Francis and Bessant’s “4P’s” model – is an effective product innovation strategy for producers of mature and credence goods as food products are. Despite the acknowledgement as one of the major industries worldwide, positional innovations about the food products are underexplored in the managerial literature. To fill this gap, this paper first develops a theoretical analysis of the concepts. Then, by adopting a case-study research methodology, it discloses the way a bakery small enterprise manages positional innovation. Theoretical and practical implications are finally introduced and discussed.


Design/methodology/approach
After a literature review about the role and the characteristics of the positional innovation, the paper presents a case study of definition and implementation of managerial actions and initiatives driven by positional innovation. The aim is not to report on an inductive study, but to use this example as a picture to clarify theory and show how the various conceptual issues may be operatively applied and provide more contextual insights.


Findings
It emerges how a small food enterprise manages positional innovation to survive and compete in the national and international markets; the positional innovation sources are tapped into culture, social responsibility, tradition and other territorial assets of tangible and intangible nature, effectively combined to innovate the product perception and/or the utility in a use context.


Originality/value
“Non-technological”, simple products, like food, are underexplored and rarely seen as relevant context to investigate along the strategic and innovation management literature. Nonetheless, positional innovation is a perspective that values and credits the innovation efforts of small food products, revealing interesting managerial concepts and inspiring entrepreneurs and managers for activating and sustaining new strategies of innovation for their businesses.

Purpose
This paper aims to investigate how business excellence (BE) custodians (BECs) design, develop and modify their BE frameworks (BEF’s) and to provide a general framework for reviewing BEFs. The design process is important to understand as these BEFs are used to help organisations understand the components of BE to guide them towards world-class performance.


Design/methodology/approach
The first step was to identify all the BE awards (BEAs) worldwide and their BEFs by conducting a review of publicly available sources. This research was then limited to only those BEAs that was held no more than two years ago. Of these, 29 BECs (with active BEAs) in 26 countries agreed to participate in the research. Data was collected with the help of a survey and 13 BECs also undertook optional follow-up interviews.


Findings
In total, 56 countries and regions have 65 active BEAs with another 17 countries having BE initiatives. The European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) excellence model and the Baldrige excellence framework are used by 37.7% and 14.5% of BECs worldwide, respectively. In total, 58.3% of the BECs review their BEFs once every three years or sooner, 100% of the BECs are confident in their BEFs’ fundamental concepts and 96.5% in their categories. There are fewer active BEAs now and the use of BE is potentially decreasing which suggests that more effort is required by the BECs in promoting BE.


Originality/value
This research collects data directly from the BECs on how BECs design and develop BEFs and provides a general framework for reviewing BEFs.

Purpose
Performance measurement and management (PMM) literature is highly abundant with numerous PMM frameworks encapsulating various aspects of enterprise performance that are largely driven by enterprise viewpoint. Considering dynamic nature of Indian telecom industry where customers hold high bargaining power in the industry, flexible strategy game-card has been adopted as a theoretical basis. The purpose of this study is to capture an “outside-in view” of enterprise performance by incorporating performance measurement from customers’ perspective and highlight dual perspectives of performance, i.e. enterprise and customers’.


Design/methodology/approach
Rigorous empirical data analysis tools have been used on the data collated through opinion survey to develop strategic performance management model for Indian telecom service providers where mediation effects of customers’-based strategic factors have also been captured.


Findings
The findings emphasize the fact that financial performance indicators are outcome variables that are driven by the external environment, internal organizational structure and business processes. An effective performance management system (PMS) should consist enabling performance indicators (customers’ perspective) in addition to leading and lagging performance indicators that are widely discussed in the literature.


Research limitations/implications
The set of performance indicators identified is in the context of Indian telecom service operators, which should be used in another context with full caution. The generalization of the empirically validated strategic performance management model in other country context is limited. However, the process of development of PMS could be taken as an example to replicate in any other context.


Originality/value
Measuring an enterprise performance from customers’ perspective is the major contribution of this study. With the diverse set of performance indicators, effective PMS can be developed and deployed where tangible measures act as lagging indicators, namely, situational and operational, strategic measures act as leading indicators, and subscribers’ crucial assessment measures act as enabling indicators.

      <data key="d3">It is estimated that in 2015 breast cancer will be the second leading cause of cancer death in women. For this purpose, biochemical markers for breast cancer have been investigated, to assist in early detection and more accurate diagnoses. In breast cancer tissue, the atypical isozyme of protein kinase C zeta, PKC-ζ, has been a topic in research; It has been shown that an overexpression of this protein may be indicative of developing carcinogenesis and contributes to proliferation through the NF kappa B pathway, which is a stress-regulated switch for cell survival. In this investigation, the expression of PKC-ζ was analyzed in normal and malignant female human breast tissue samples by Western blot, immunoprecipitation and PCR. In the preliminary results, the malignant breast tissue samples illustrated a significant expression of PKC ζ when compared to the expression of PKC-ζ in normal breast tissue samples. The same tissues were also processed for total RNA isolation which was followed by cDNA synthesis and Real Time PCR. The level of PKC-ζ mRNA was tested and no overexpression was observed in either malignant or normal breast tissue samples. While protein studies may suggest that PKC-ζ could be considered a biomarker for breast cancer, the same cannot be said about mRNA levels. The overexpression of PKC-ζ protein level and the normal PKC-ζ mRNA level are indicators of possible miRNA activity that may regulate translation in malignant tissues but not the normal.

Postulamos que en la medida en que el concepto de autonomia se reduzca al de independencia, se corre el riesgo de componer practicas afines al capitalismo neoliberal. Este ultimo entendido no solo como sistema economico, sino como orden productor de subjetividades en torno al individualismo, la competencia, el consumismo y el desgarramiento de los vinculos. En contraste, proponemos articular autonomia y etica del cuidado. El cuidado permite visibilizar las redes afectivas y materiales que sostienen la vida. Lejos de una categorizacion estatica y dicotomica que clasifica a las personas en “independientes” y “dependientes”, postulamos la necesidad de toda vida, de ser cuidada. De esta manera, se trata en todo caso de diferentes flujos de intensidades en las necesidades de cuidado. A partir del acoplamiento entre cuidado y autonomia finalizamos este escrito con la propuesta del concepto de “autonomia interdependiente”. EnglishThe present work approach the notions of autonomy, care and interdependence, as keys that allow us to reflect on professional practices in the field of disability. It is proposed to delve into possible senses, as well as convergences and tensions between these concepts. We postulate that to the extent that the concept of autonomy is reduced to that of independence, there is a risk of composing practices related to neoliberal capitalism. The latter understood not only as an economic system, but as a producer order of subjectivities around individualism, competition, consumerism, and the tearing of ties. In contrast, we propose to articulate autonomy and ethics of care. Care makes visible the affective networks and materials that sustain life. Far from a static and dichotomous categorization that classifies people as "independent" and "dependent," we postulate the need for care of all lives. In this way, it is in any case different flows of intensities in care needs. From the coupling between care and autonomy, we finalize this writing with the proposal of the concept of “interdependent autonomy”.</data>

Purpose
The lack of suitable indicators tailored to manufacturing industries’ needs, particularly to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), has been the major challenge to measure and manage industrial sustainability performance. This paper aims to empirically analyze and select the useful and applicable indicators to measure sustainability performance in the context of SMEs.


Design/methodology/approach
A systematic review was carried out to identify potential sustainability indicators from the literature. A questionnaire was designed based on the identified indicators and then pretested with the selected industrial experts, scholars, and researchers to further refine the indicators before data collection from the Italian footwear SMEs. Fuzzy Delphi method with consistency aggregation method was applied to analyze and select the final indicators.


Findings
The study’s findings show that the selected indicators emphasized measuring progress toward achieving industrial sustainability goals in terms of increasing financial benefits, reducing costs, improving market competitiveness, improving the effectiveness of resources utilization, and promoting the well-being of employees, customers and the community. In doing so, Italian footwear SMEs can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting health and well-being, promoting sustainable economic growth, providing productive employment and decent work, and ensuring responsible consumption and production.


Social implications
The results of this study have significant social implications in terms of promoting the well-being of employees, customers, and the community.


Originality/value
By providing empirically supported indicators tailored to measure and manage sustainability performance in the context of SMEs, this paper contributes to the existing knowledge in the field of industrial sustainability performance measurement. Furthermore, it links the selected indicators to their respective SDGs to provide policy implications.

Salah satu point penting yang ditanggapi di artikel ini adalah bahwa ternyata DKL berusaha memahami narasi “Pergumulan Yakub dengan Allah” (Kej 32:22-32) dalam konteks narasi menyeluruh Yakub-Esau, namun ia hanya memperhatikan konteks sebelum perikop tersebut dan mengabaikan konteks sesudahnya, khususnya Kej 33:1-20. Metode yang digunakan dalam artikel ini adalah dengan menganalisis “Kisah Yakub di Yabok” (Kej 32:22-32) dalam terang Kej 33:10 dan berusaha menemukan pemaknaan baru dan aktualisasinya dalam kehidupan beragama di Indonesia. Dari penelitian ini, ditemukan dua point penting: (1) Setuju dengan pendapat DKL, bahwa kisah Yakub di Yabok merupakan sebuah pengalaman mistik dalam mimpi (atau penglihatan), namun bukan pengalaman  unio mystica  (kesatuan mistik); dan (2) Kemenangan Yakub terhadap Allah di Yabok membawa perubahan sudut pandang dalam diri Yakub dalam memandang Esau, kakaknya. Pengalaman Yakub dengan Esau dapat pula diaktualisasikan pada relasi Kristen-Islam di Indonesia, di mana relasi ini tidak selalu baik. Namun pada akhirnya, kita diajak (Umat Kristen) untuk melihat Umat Islam di Indonesia itu secara keseluruhan, ternyata mereka seperti Esau yang menyambut Yakub dengan baik, “Ia ternyata baik!”.</data>

Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the causal interrelations among the four pillars of corporate sustainability, which indicate a firm’s contribution to environmental, social, governance and economic activities. Moreover, this study identifies the critical drivers of corporate sustainability by focusing on the levels of market developments and geographical regions.


Design/methodology/approach Based on corporate sustainability data of 2,725 global companies in 2016, this study uses a combination of analytical techniques including cluster analysis, data mining, partial least square path modeling and importance performance map analysis.


Findings This study finds that companies in European developed markets exhibit the highest-ranking of corporate sustainability. In line with the social impact hypothesis, environmental, social and governance performance positively affects economic performance. Moreover, there is strong evidence of causal relationships and synergistic effects among the four pillars of corporate sustainability. In accordance with the institutional theory, the patterns of causal directions and the critical pillars depend on levels of market developments and geographical regions. Overall, social and environmental pillars are among the most critical drivers of corporate sustainability.


Research limitations/implications The methodology does not aim to provide a new weighting scheme for calculating the corporate sustainability index.


Practical implications Corporate managers should consider sustainability practices in all dimensions to benefit from synergistic effects among environmental, social, governance and economic activities. Furthermore, corporate sustainability strategies should not be generalized across countries with different levels of market developments and geographical regions.


Originality/value This study prioritizes environmental, social, governance and economic pillars of corporate sustainability in emerging and developed markets across geographical regions.

      <data key="d1">2019</data>
      <data key="d2">Navitha Singh Sewpersadh</data>
      <data key="d3">The recent collapse of the corporate giant Steinhoff in South Africa (SA) has highlighted the risks of a dominant Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and an ineffective governing board. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to scrutinize the influence of CEO power attributes and independent governing boards on the growth of a Johannesburg stock exchange-listed firm.,The purpose of this paper is to answer the research question “Under the monitoring role of the board, what CEO attributes, theoretically and in practice preeminent successful firm growth strategies?” This question was answered by examining 130 companies over six years using the econometric methodology of generalized least squares and ordinary least squares with the specific inclusion of generalized method of moments estimation due to its efficiency in controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, amongst others. The proxies for CEO power are CEO tenure, turnover and professional skills as well as the explanatory variable of board vigilance. The response variable was firm growth.,This study found that CEO tenure is negatively correlated with firm growth indicating that long-tenured CEOs may stagnate the firm's growth. Furthermore, CEO turnover was positively correlated with firm growth indicating that a new CEO may bring innovative strategies that link to this study's finding on CEO tenure. The membership of CEOs to accounting professional bodies and board vigilance are also positively correlated to firm growth.,SA firms' growth policy does not solely depend on the neoclassical fundamental determinants of profitability, net worth, and cash flows. Since the value relevance of assessing CEO attributes as well as board vigilance in the SA market has proved to be very significant and will contribute to future decision making on growth strategies. This study innovatively illustrates the different drivers of firm growth, which is distinct from the normal macroeconomic indicators. The practical contribution of the study lies in the fact that organizations now discern which CEO attributes contribute to sustainability and profitability.,The current depressed economic environment has several negative implications for the citizens of SA. The rising unemployment levels and inflation has deteriorated living conditions. For the economy to recover, SA needs its listed companies to remain strong performers to protect stakeholder interests and attract investments. The people responsible for steering the companies through this difficult time are the CEOs with the governing board protecting the public interest. This study examines these two important constructs concerning firm growth.,This study uniquely used a firm growth variable as opposed to the multitude of studies that used firm performance variables. Furthermore, this study's robustness was bolstered by an extensive theoretical framework employed to examine the value of a CEO as a firm growth stimulator. The period of this study is also unique as it examines firms in the aftermath of the global recession of 2008. This study provides a fresh perspective on firm growth indicators and has key implications for policymakers, stakeholders and regulatory establishments.</data>

      <data key="d1">2021</data>
      <data key="d2">Yiching Lin</data>
      <data key="d3">
Purpose
This study aims to investigate the relationship between project management competency, job motivation and performance in people engaged in electronic commerce (e-commerce). A questionnaire was developed for e-commerce workers in various professional aspects including business strategy planning, content management and design, sales services, marketing business sales, host settings, analysis and management. A total of 299 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Multiple regression analysis was applied to the testing and analysis on important competences for project management and the factors influencing job performance.


Design/methodology/approach
In this study, the related indexes are measured mainly through appropriate questionnaire design and the questionnaires were mainly distributed among employees and managers of the e-commerce enterprises. Tables 5–1 provide the personal profiles of the e-commerce personnel. A total of 350 questionnaires were distributed and 320 questionnaires were returned. After the 320 questionnaires were sorted and categorized, 21 incompletely-filled and invalid questionnaires were excluded, for a total of 299 valid questionnaires that were returned. Based on the quantitative data obtained from the returned valid questionnaires, files were created and statistical analyzes were conducted by the computerized statistical software statistical product and service solutions 21. According to the research question and nature of this study, the present study mainly adopted statistical methods, including descriptive statistical analysis, reliability analysis, Pearson’s correlation analysis and regression analysis.


Findings
The results suggested that the project management competency of those engaged in e-commerce had a positive influence on their work performance. The capabilities in the management of integration, scope and procurement were significantly important factors identified in this study. In addition, the internal and external motivations of those engaged in e-commerce had a positive influence on work performance, and thus, facilitated their influence on the project management competency. The results and statistical analysis could be a reference in e-commerce-related business management and serve as the basis for evaluation of the training of project management competencies for those engaged in e-commerce and further improvements of human capitals and corporate competitive advantages.


Originality/value
This study used literature on project management competence and job performance as a foundation; previous studies argue that project management competence has a positive correlation with job performance. Empirical results reveal that among the e-commerce personnel, most dimensions of project management competence are significantly correlated with job performance. This study reveals that stakeholder management competence, the newly introduced 10th dimension of project management competence, is also significantly correlated with job performance. Therefore, study results reveal that project management competence has a significant positive correlation with job performance. In this study, the two constructs of internal motivation and external motivation in job motivation are introduced for use as disturbing factors. Empirical results reveal that internal motivation and external motivation have a significant positive disturbing effect with respect to the influence of cost management competence and human resource management competence on job performance. Hackman and Oldham (1975) contend that the jobs calling for a variety of skills can boost the job motivation of employees. Study results reveal that job motivation is of great importance to the influence of project management competence on job performance and can be used as the basis for improving job performance.

This paper aims to discuss the importance of reconsidering the business model in the organizations, to ensure success over time. The paper lies on the analysis and development of the strategies of ten “Societa” Canottieri’ – multi-sports clubs in Northern Italy. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The strategies of these clubs have been studied via detailed interviews, as well as data and document analysis. Subsequently, two workshops with the management of the clubs were carried out, to collect evidence of the challenges to their sustainability and to identify possible strategies to overcome these challenges. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Drawing on Osterwalder’s Business Model Canvas framework and Demil et Lecocq’s approach to business model (a Penrosian approach about the on-going dimension of change as a permanent state of organization), the paper describes how recently emerging issues (external and internal changes) have challenged the traditional business model of these clubs. Finally, authors identify specific actions necessary to (re)create a new value proposition and to modify the sports clubs’ organization in the future, to assure sustainability and success. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
Currently, business model analysis within contexts of (apparent) no economic value creation still remains a relatively unexplored field. The paper describes an effective methodology to implement the business model analysis into a group of independent non-profit organizations. To implement this analysis, the authors adopted the model of Business Model Canvas, but using a transformational and dynamic approach.</data>

Purpose
The use of natural resources by organizations has a significant impact on society, resulting in business firms playing a vital role in developing sustainable development. As a result, corporate sustainability has become an integral aspect of a company’s vision and policy in the modern days. Companies issue sustainability reports based on various criteria and metrics, thereby attempting to gain a competitive edge. This study aims to assess and prioritize the numerous factors that influence corporate sustainability performance.


Design/methodology/approach
The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to prioritize the identified determinants of corporate sustainability performance based on the literature. Several experts from business and academia were engaged to build a comparison matrix for assessing the various aspects of corporate sustainability performance. As a result, various corporate sustainability determinants were determined and prioritized following an extensive literature review using the AHP.


Findings
The most critical component for companies is an economic indicator. Developing environmentally and socially responsible suggestions must be a priority for the organization’s economic performance. Economic performance is believed to be most heavily influenced by innovation and in the other category like environmental and social performance are highly influenced by environment management policies and shareholder responsibility, respectively. Researchers’ findings suggest that to promote sustainability, top executives should devote all of their attention to innovation, environment management policies and shareholder responsibility.


Research limitations/implications
These studies are primarily concerned with developed countries. And, the other fundamental constraint of the AHP study is that the rating scale adopted in the analysis is conceptual. Therefore, pairwise comparisons with a variety of indicators have the potential to introduce bias into the results.


Practical implications
This paper proposes a methodical and operational technique for selecting the ultimate priority of sustainability indicators when it comes to exploiting competitive information on business performance. The paper also recommended sustainability rating technique might be carried out once every six months to improve the overall quality and performance of the organization.


Originality/value
The advantages of adopting and executing corporate sustainability are enormous, and managers must determine whether sustainability is profitable or not. This question prompts further inquiries. For example, what are the numerous critical determinants of corporate sustainability performance? Several scholars throughout the world are looking at it for this reason. As a result, it is essential to comprehend and prioritize the various determinants of corporate sustainability performance.

En este sentido, Ferdowsi presto atencion delicadamente en el desarrollo de personajes femeninos de Shahnameh. En este articulo, se intenta investigar aspectos miticos, liricos y sociales de las mujeres en diferentes secciones de Shahnameh. Se revisan aspectos miticos de Shahnameh, incluidas las creencias zoroastrianas. Las bases liricas que incluyen poesia, juego, amor y matrimonio se consideran en esta investigacion. Y se encuentran muchas mujeres como Roodabeh, Tahmineh y Jarireh que contribuyen a los aspectos liricos de Shahnameh y se investiga y describe su caracter y otras dimensiones relacionadas. Curiosamente, se encuentra que en las historias de Shahnameh, la galanteria por si sola no puede ayudar a un heroe a alcanzar sus objetivos a menos que el amor y el afecto se combinen con el. Ademas, nuestra investigacion muestra que algunas mujeres en Shahnameh expresan su amor conscientemente sobre su amado hombre.

The infection rates were very different even in virus endemic areas as Asia-Pacific countries including Japan. However, an association between virus infection and lymphoma should be evaluated and discussed with the background of virus prevalence in the community. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of HBV or HCV infection status in lymphoma patients in Tohoku distinct in Japan. Patients and Methods The study, designed by the Tohoku Hematology Forum Group, was conducted in 9 clinical centers in Tohoku Distinct in Japan. This study included 1331 newly diagnosed consecutive series of lymphoma patients admitted in Tohoku Hematology Forum Group Hospital (Japan) and 848 non-lymphoma control patients enrolled from January 2005 to October 2008. We evaluated the prevalence of HBV (as indicated by hepatitis B surface antigen) or HCV infection in both group patients and compared the clinic-pathological characteristics of HBV- or HCV-positive and its negative lymphoma cases. Results The carrier rate of HBsAg was higher in lymphoma patients (57 of 1331, 4.3%) than control group (1.7%, p Conclusions The present study, so far the largest trial of incidence of HBV or HCV infection in lymphoma patients, demonstrated that patients with lymphoma in Japan had higher prevalence of HBV and HCV infection. These appears to be a possible role for HBV or HCV in the induction of malignant transformation, resulting in the development of lymphoma. However, the precise role of HBV or HCV in the pathogenesis of lymphoma remains to be elucidated and warrants further research. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.</data>

The authors made an attempt to find key strategic and operational decision-making dimensions for developing effective supply chain flexibility environment.,The authors have extracted 11 supply chain flexibility dimensions through extensive literature review. The authors used a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) to make causal analysis and prioritizing the dimensions. After DEMATEL analysis three major supply chain flexibility dimensions that seem to have significant amount of influence on supply chain performance of the firms were retained for further consideration. The authors have developed an excel-based template for quantitative assessment of flexibility performance indicators.,This study provides key enablers for the successful implementation of flexibility concepts in Indian soap manufacturing firms and gives a view how to measure the performance through designing template based on real data. This template can be used in other firms also by simply modifying the key attributes.,A flexibility index has been defined here with the purpose of assessing the level of flexibility vis-a-vis what is desired and is meant to be evaluated from time to time, to assess if the firm is improving its flexibility or not. The index assumes importance in view of the fact that it has been prepared based on feedbacks of both the upper and the lower management people of the firm engaged in policymaking and operations.</data>

The zombie causes fear in two directions: the first, to be devoured by it and, the second, to become one. Its ontological position places it between the subject and the object, breaking the dual models, regardless of gender, socioeconomic statu or geography, so it is the ideal metaphor for contemporany social analysis, where marxist, post cololinal and gender, post structuralist, postmodern, posthumanist theories can dialogue. From a theoretical approach, from anthropology, sociology and cinema, this essay ponder on the zombie outside the classical reductionist views, which have placed it as a marginal cultural product, intended to satisfy playful momento, contrary to this position, what is intended, rather, is to give a critical view of the zombie and its contemporary social interference.</data>

      <data key="d3">La indagación que aquí se plantea intenta poner en evidencia los vínculos y complicidades entre dos tipos de racionalidad que entendemos como dos caras de la colonialidad pedagógica: la razón evaluadora y la razón punitiva. Tal como pensamos este asunto, resulta difícil entender la una sin la otra operando de algún modo más o menos visible dependiendo el caso. Por ello, explorar dichos vínculos en algunos discursos pedagógicos del siglo XX aportará elementos contundentes de análisis que mostrarán hasta qué punto están relacionadas y nuestro presente se encuentra atravesado por ellas. Así, podremos observar cómo la razón punitiva forma parte de la razón evaluadora que no solo judicializa los vínculos pedagógicos al interior de instancias educativas, sino que su afán inclusivo también se encuentra signado por diferentes formas de violencia, crueldad y castigo. Esto también invita a pensar la importancia de interrumpir la sinonimia instalada por la modernidad/colonialidad entre educación y evaluación, como modo principal de resistencia a los regímenes pedagógicos que proto-criminalizan lo considerado “anormal”, condenan el error y juzgan toda potencia de alteridad. Por último, se plantea una defensa del error como parte constitutiva de lo que somos y como tentativa para pensar una justicia (pedagógica) de alteridad.</data>

Purpose
Considering the role of the textile industry in the generation of employment and export in the Indian economy, it is important to comprehend the efficiency level in the operations of the textile units located in different states in India. In this light, the purpose of this paper is to examine the operational efficiency of textile manufacturing units in Haryana, a northern state of India.


Design/methodology/approach
The study applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach consisting of input-oriented CCR and BCC techniques along with the return to scale technique for the analysis of five years of data from 2015–2016 to 2019–2020.


Findings
The results reveal that Haryana’s textile units have significantly underperformed operationally, with an average technical efficiency score of just 0.25 for five years, from 2015–2016 to 2019–2020. The yearly ratings of the overall technical efficiency of the selected textile companies include 0.20, 0.18, 0.18, 0.40 and 0.28; PTE scores are 0.43, 0.43, 0.55, 0.60, 0.62 and scale efficiency scores 0.54, 0.44, 0.29, 0.71, 0.38, respectively, from 2015–2016 to 2019–2020. On the other hand, average of 5.8 units are functioning at the constant return to scale, 10.2 units are at increasing return to scale and average of 45 units are functioning at decreasing return to scale (DRS). It is found that most of the companies are functioning at a DRS; to boost efficiency, these companies must reduce their input size since they are running at a DRS.


Practical implications
The results of the current paper provide key insight into the inefficiency level of the textile manufacturing industry in the context of northern India. Industry professionals can take corrective measures based on these findings. Moreover, for investors and portfolio managers, knowing which companies are efficient and which are not will help them make better decisions. The study helps policymakers to frame appropriate policy guidelines to make the textile units in the state more efficient and competitive.


Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study has been done so far on the operational performance of the textile industry in Haryana based on the DEA technique. So, it will contribute to the extant literature on the performance of the textile industry.

      <data key="d2">Christine Fritsch; Estelle Pfister; Nicolas Ebel; Daniel Guthy; Christian Schnell; Francesco Hofmann</data>
      <data key="d3">Over the past years, a key focus has been on identifying inhibitors against components of pathways that drive tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis such as the PI3K/mTOR pathway, known to be implicated in many human cancers through various mechanisms, such as, somatic PIK3CA missense mutations that occur at high frequency in a number of common solid tumors including ~40% of ER+ breast cancer patients. Based on these findings, cancer-specific mutants of PI3Kα appear to be ideal targets for PI3Kα selective inhibitors such as alpelisib which is unique in its relative selectivity for the α-isoform and previously reported to be efficacious in PIK3CA mutant cancer models. Recently, using the ER-negative/HER2-positive/PIK3CA mutant HCC1954 breast cancer cell line, the PI3K β-sparing inhibitor taselisib has been described to have a dual mechanism of action, both blocking PI3K signaling and inducing a decrease in p110α protein levels. Here, we investigated whether such dual mechanism of action could be associated with PI3Kα selective inhibition in ER+/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer pre-clinical models specifically. In vitro, using the T47D ER+/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell line, alpelisib displays dual MoA by inhibiting p-Akt and inducing a decrease of p110a protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. This effect is observed upon 24 hours of compound treatment and is maintained for at least 96 hours upon treatment. Interestingly, for both alpelisib and taselisib, p110α degradation becomes more pronounced at concentrations which produce strong PI3K pathway inhibition (&gt;80% p-Akt inhibition). In contrast to T47D cells, we do not observe p110α degradation upon 24 hours treatment in 4 additional ER+/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell lines tested, despite a dose-dependent and robust inhibition of the PI3K pathway, suggesting the effect might be specific to certain cell lines or restricted to certain PIK3CA mutations or might require longer compound treatment periods. In the EFM19 cells, the PI3K inhibition-mediated p110α degradation occurs upon minimum 48 hours treatment for both alpelisib and taselisib. In vitro, when alpelisib and taselisib are then compared at concentrations that equally inhibit the PI3K pathway and equally degrade p110α, both compounds display similar inhibitory effects on T47D and EFM19 cell proliferation and survival. In vivo, in an ER+/ PIK3CA mutant breast cancer patient derived xenograft (PTX) model, alpelisib and taselisib show comparable anti-tumoral efficacy when administered at doses that are equally well tolerated and induced comparable PI3K pathway modulation. Overall, the data demonstrate that in ER+/ PIK3CA mutant breast cancer pre-clinical models, selective PI3Kα inhibition can induce a dual mechanism of action and produces robust efficacy.

The research material consisted of carcasses from male deer slaughtered at the age of 20-21 months. Carcass weight, the weight and percentage share of cuts and internal organs, and correlations between selected parameters were determined. The rump was shown to have the largest percentage share of the carcass, followed by the shoulders and loins. Significant statistical correlations were noted between those cuts and the total carcass weight. Linear regression revealed significant relationships between the weights of individual cuts, which will make it possible to determine them without the need to dissect the carcass. The development of indirect methods of evaluating carcasses can also facilitate their classification, e.g. in meat processing plants.</data>

      <data key="d3">When working remotely with mobile robotics, a reliable wireless communication network becomes essential, especially in large operating regions. As most teleoperated robots rely on standard Wi-Fi communication, network behavior has a crucial effect on autonomous robot control. The main goal of this research is to measure and diagnose the system reliability, roaming issues, and bottlenecks of such data transmission. To study these significant factors, two measurement scenarios were conducted. Measurements consist of two Wi-Fi access points (AP) and a TurtleBot II robot used in two different system set-up configurations. In the first configuration, two APs are connected in bridge mode (LAN connection) and in the second configuration the APs are connected in WDS bridge (Wireless Data Distribution) mode. This article presents the results of Robot Operating System (ROS) IEEE 802.11 network measurements in roaming mode, in wireless bridge mode, and in an extended coverage area employed in WDS mode. Results of data transmission measurements, configurations, and evaluation of the entire system are also presented. All the measurements utilize the Open Cloud Robotic Platform (OpenCRP)1 an open-source cloud robotics ecosystem based on service-oriented PaaS architecture using the Ubuntu Linux operating system.</data>

El presente articulo examina como el autor aborda todos estos temas en la novela. EnglishBritish writer Bruce Chatwin (1940-1989) makes a compulsive collector the central axis of his novel Utz. Through that character, he reflects on the art world remembering his work at the auction house Sotheby´s. His experience there gave him the knowledge and look that would condition his life. He learnt to analyze a work of art, to describe it in just a few words and to value it in the market. All of it can be noticed in his writing style, in which he pursues the kind of the precision observed in cataloguers. He developed his own technique. Besides, he acquired a strong contact network around the world. He put his eyes on peculiar personalities that led to the creation of Utz, personification of all those art dealers and collectors that he met during his time as the head of the firm's Impressionist and Modern Art department.

Apart from that, these elements were also sought and found by analyzing the Second Vatican Council’s Dogmatic Constitution ‘Lumen Gentium, especially the section on the Church’s view of Mary (53-69).

      <data key="d3">Survival rates for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer have not improved in the past 20 years, and new therapies are imperative. Intratumor heterogeneity can complicate molecular profiling attempts to optimize therapy for cancers harboring several actionable tumor subclones. To develop personalized treatment strategies, there is a need for assays to measure intratumor heterogeneity in bladder cancers. We conducted a pilot study of two muscle invasive high-grade transitional cell carcinoma cases. We used a comprehensive cancer panel (Thermo Fisher) covering &gt;400 cancer genes to analyze distinct tumor loci and matched normal tissues. Based on the identified somatic mutations, we designed a bladder-specific panel to (1) validate our results with increased coverage, and (2) analyze liquid biopsy samples. Using the comprehensive cancer panel, we sequenced 6 tumor loci to an average sequencing depth of approximately 100x. We detected intratumor heterogeneity in both patients: By applying a combination of frequency-based (minor allele frequency &gt;10%) and probabilistic (probability of difference between observed frequencies due to sampling) filters, we identified 44 credible somatic SNVs, including mutations that were not shared among all three loci. We used these SNVs to design a custom amplicon panel covering 42 SNVs across 38 genes that is suitable for highly fragmented DNA. The custom panel was used to validate the SNVs in the same tumor regions and in liquid biopsy samples from plasma and urine (approximate coverage 6,000x). In both cases, we identified private mutations reported in The Cancer Genome Atlas Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma (TCGA-BLCA) data collection, reflecting tumor evolution. Liquid biopsy samples from urine revealed all trunk mutations but only 1 out of 5 private mutations. We conclude that tumor evolution can affect distinct loci within bladder tumors, which may not be fully represented in liquid biopsy samples. These results suggest the need for analyzing multiple tumor regions to identify all actionable driver mutations. In the future, we plan to apply our assay to additional foci and patients in order to identify optimal bladder tumor sampling strategies.

Machine learning (ML) is widely used in this area. One of the most promising subsets from ML is deep learning that achieves remarkable performance in various areas. Two deep learning algorithms are used in this paper, the Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In order to evaluate the studied algorithms, four commonly used datasets from NASA are used i.e. (PC1, KC1, KC2 and CM1). The experiment results show how the CNN algorithm achieves prediction superiority of the MLP algorithm. The accuracy and detection rate measurements when using CNN has reached the standard ratio respectively as follows: PC1 97.7% - 73.9%, KC1 100% - 100%, KC2 99.3% - 99.2% and CM1 97.3% - 82.3%.

      <data key="d3">To investigate the biophysical mechanisms that regulate the spatial dynamics of blood coagulation, we have developed a set of microfluidic tools that allow analysis and perturbation of blood coagulation on the micrometer scale with precise control of fluid flow, geometry, and surface chemistry. Physiological coagulation occurs in a localized manner; specifically, coagulation is believed to occur exclusively at regions of substantial vascular damage and does not spread throughout the entire vascular system. In vitro analysis and characterization of these spatial dynamics requires the ability to reproduce and perturb this system, an ability that is not provided by the mixed reactor systems commonly used for in vitro studies of blood coagulation. We developed microfluidic devices with micrometer-scale channels and methods to coat these channels with various phospholipids, including components of the blood coagulation network such as thrombomodulin and tissue factor, to reproduce in vitro the geometry and surface chemistry of blood vessels in vitro. In a microfluidic device with channels coated with phospholipids and thrombomodulin, we demonstrated that clots propagate in a wave-like fashion with a constant velocity in the absence of flow. We also showed that propagation of coagulation from an occluded channel to a channel with flowing blood plasma can be regulated by the geometry of the junction and the shear rate in the channel with flowing plasma. We also developed microfluidic tools to probe the spatial dynamics of initiation of clotting by patterning surfaces with tissue factor reconstituted into phospholipids bilayers. When human plasma or whole blood was exposed to these surfaces in a microfluidic device, clotting occurred only on patches of tissue factor larger than a threshold size. This threshold patch size is controlled by the rate of activation of clotting factors at the patch and the rate of transport of activated factors off the patch. These results suggest a mechanism for how tissue factor can circulate in blood without causing clotting, and how small regions of vascular damage can exist without causing clotting. These results also suggest new biophysical mechanisms that may control interactions between the coagulation cascade and bacterial surfaces.</data>

We know surely that it has great impacts to human progress especially in healthcare, education, economics, and environment. Our tasks become easier by the help of AI. Unfortunately, besides its enormous benefit, AI can also be a threat to humanity. What kind of the threat and how theology should contribute? This question is analyzed and answered from moral theology point of view by using the method of contextual theology. This essay finds that algorithmic bias in AI system is a threat to humanity especially in the name of human dignity. Pope John Paul II in his Evangelium Vitae (1995) no 3. says, “Every threat to human dignity and life must necessarily be felt in the Church’s very heart”. It is important and urgent to build a theology vis-a-vis AI. Theology cannot escape from AI especially when it encounters human dignity. While looking toward todays’ impacts of AI, analysis on John Paul II’s thougths on human dignity leads to a meaningful point in Fides et Ratio (1998) about cooperation between theologians, philosophers, and scientists which could be realized through dialogue.</data>

      <data key="d3">The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest source of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain. Emerging research indicates that NSCs within the SVZ may be cells of origin for WHO grade IV astrocytoma (glioblastoma, GBM)1. GBM consists of multiple fractions of proliferative and/or quiescent stem-like cells that are thought to be lineally related. GBM located adjacent to the SVZ are very resistant to standard of care concurrent temozolomide (TMZ)/X-irradiation (XRT) therapy, a consequence, it is hypothesized, of their NSC origin2. An important, unanswered question is the origin of this resistance. While a significant effort has been undertaken to study proliferating cells, the origins of quiescent cell resistance are not well understood. Normal NSCs adjacent to the SVZ are mainly quiescent. We rationalized that a fundamental understanding of the response of quiescent NSCs to TMZ/XRT would be informative and aid in our understanding of GBM resistance. For 5 consecutive days cohorts of C57BL/6 mice were administered TMZ (0 or 50 mg.kg i.p.). One hr later 0 or 2 Gy was administered to the brain. Transcardial perfusion was performed on day 6 for half the mice. The remaining mice received adjuvant TMZ (100 mg/kg) or vehicle on days 19-22 and transcardial perfusion was performed on day 82. 10 µm coronal brain sections were obtained and immunostained for well characterized markers of type B NSCs (GFAP and Sox2) and type A neuroblasts (Dcx). Immunofluorescence was imaged using a Leica Aperio Versa 200 slide scanning microscope. Cell Profiler software was used to quantify type B and A cells in the SVZ in all cohorts. Proliferating type A cells were exquisitely sensitive to 5 days of concurrent TMZ/XRT treatment whereas quiescent NSCs located within 30 µm of a dorsal or dorsolateral ventricle were very resistant. NSCs in mice exposed to concurrent and adjuvant therapy were also resistant and importantly, able to repopulate type A cells to sham/control levels. 53BP1 foci formation, a surrogate for DNA DSBs, was quantified in Sox2- and Dcx-expressing cells using confocal microscopy following a single TMZ/XRT exposure. Foci formation, measured 6 min to 24 hrs after TMZ/XRT, was not statistically different between cell types (P&gt;0.05). Because TMZ/XRT induced an apoptotic response in A but not in B cells, as marked by cleaved Caspase-3 staining, we investigated expression of Bax and Bcl2 on a per cell basis. Bax expression was not significantly different for type A or B cells (P&gt;0.05). In contrast, type B NSCs expressed 5-fold more Bcl2 than type A neuroblasts (P Citation Format: Brent D.

      <data key="d3">Executive function is comprised of different behavioral and cognitive elements and is considered to play a significant role in learning and academic achievement. Educational researchers frequently study the construct. However, because of its complexity functionally, the research on executive function can at times be both confusing and contradictory. To attempt to bring some clarity to the construct, a systematic review of contemporary empirical studies was conducted. A PsycInfo database search was conducted and 106 empirical studies were selected for review. The analyses explored specific aspects of these studies such as how executive function is defined and measured, and in what domains and population groups is it studied. The resulting analyses identified both points of convergence and divergence, as well as issues with both the conceptualization and operationalization of executive function.</data>

      <data key="d3">To study the impacts of toxin produced by phytoplankton and refuges provided for phytoplankton on phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions in lakes, we establish a simple phytoplankton-zooplankton system with Holling type II response function. The existence and stability of positive equilibria are discussed. Bifurcation analyses are given by using normal form theory which reveals reasonably the mechanisms and nonlinear dynamics of the effects of toxin and refuges, including Hopf bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of co-dimension 2 and 3. Numerical simulations are carried out to intuitively support our analytical results and help to explain the observed biological behaviors. Our findings finally show that both phytoplankton refuge and toxin have a significant impact on the occurring and terminating of algal blooms in freshwater lakes.</data>

      <data key="d3">The combinatorial strategy is useful in the reduction of the number of input parameters into a compact set of a system based on the combinations of the parameters. This strategy can be used in testing the behaviour that takes place when the events are allowed to be executed in an appropriate order. Basically, in the software systems, for the highly configurable system, the input configurations are based on the constraints, and the construction of this idea undergoes various kinds of difficulties. The proposed Jaya-Bat optimization algorithm is developed with the combinatorial interaction test cases in an effective manner in the presence of the constraints. The proposed Jaya-Bat based optimization algorithm is the integration of the Jaya optimization algorithm (JOA) and the Bat optimization algorithm (BA). The experimentation is carried out in terms of average size and the average time to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. From the results, it is clear that the proposed algorithm is capable of selecting the test cases optimally with better performance.</data>

      <data key="d3">The birth of Anabaptist movement appeared in the context of church reformation by Martin Luther in the sixteenth century in Europe.Anabaptist movement was aimed to renewing the Church according to the Scriptures, because many Protestant reformers, such as Luther and Zwingli, were not radical. They still practice some of the rules and teachings of the Roman Catholic church, such as infant baptism and maintaining the Church's relationship with the State. The Anabaptists movement rejects these practices. The Anabaptists attempted to carry out a more radical reform than their predecessors. The Anabaptist group itself has a membership of about 1.7 million worldwide. The data raises the question of how they made their mission. The facts show that the Anabaptists were persistent missionaries in preaching their Faith. The Anabaptist mission is based on three Anabaptist beliefs: Jesus became the center of faith, Mennonite who put peace and community as the center of life. These three beliefs will be analyzed using David J. Bosch's three paradigms to see the correlation between "Mission as Mediating Salvation” and the belief that Jesus is the center of faith, "Mission as Evangelism" with Mennonite beliefs that promote peace, and "Mission as Ministry by the Whole People of God” with community is the center of live. The results of this analysis will show the radicalism of the Anabaptist movement.</data>

There were used 2 biological batches in our studies. One batch of the biological product was made on the basis of a dry mixture, which is called ‘11-Tigers by “Eleven Tigers Herbal Bar Energizer” and consists of seven species of plants of foreign origin. The other type is based on a dry mixture of 7 plants of domestic origin.
Biologicals “Biosvit” and “Megasvit” experimental groups of animals (D 1) and (D 2) were injected subcutaneously at the rate of 3-4 mg of active substance per 1 kg of the body weight (on average 15 ml) per 1 animal. Biologicals were injected to the above animals five times, every 72 hours. Milk samples, taken from the formed groups of cows, were monitored for physico-chemical parameters.
It was carried out that under the influence of two types of drugs “Biosvit” and “Megasvi” the productivity of cows in experimental groups increased, and in the milk samples from the cows in these groups (D 1) and (D 2), there was an increase in mass fraction: fat by 0,19 and 0,2%; protein by 0,15 and 0,16%; lactose by 0,13 and 0,14%; dry matter by 0,35 and 0,45%, skimmed milk powder by 0,15 and 0,19%, protein by 0,16 (P ≥ 0,95) and 0,28% respectively, compared with the control group of cows (K(controlled)). It can be noted that under the influence of the biological product “Megasvit” there was a more significant increase in the mass fraction of fat by 0,11%; protein by 0,25%, compared with similar indicators of the biological product “Biosvit”.

      <data key="d3">Abstract: As a renewable, biodegradable, and non-toxic fuel, biodiesel has attracted a lot of attention during the past century. It is a methyl ester of a fatty acid made from triglycerides by the methanol transesterification process. Due to the alarming rise in automobile ownership over the past year, there is now more focus on finding alternatives to diesel fuel as both demand and costs for petroleum goods have increased. The majority of biodiesel is currently made from refined or oil seeds using an alkaline catalyst and methanol. Large quantities of oil and fat, however, cannot be ingested. However, it is realistic to use a lot of nonedible oil and fat in our nation. Neem oil is utilized in this study as an alternate fuel to create biodiesel. By combining high-free fatty acid (FFA) oil with the best methanol and H2SO4 acid catalyst properties, biodiesel is created utilizing this process using methanol and KOH catalyst</data>

The purpose of this study is to investigate the uses of performance measures in startup firms, including perceived importance and performance of those measures. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The survey method is used in this study. Data are collected from founders/chief executive officers/managers of 110 startups in Thailand. The correlation analysis and analysis of variance techniques are used as the analysis tool in this study. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results show that there is a positive relationship between the perceived importance and the performance of each metric. However, no significant differences are found in the importance and performance of each metric among the various stages of startups. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
Because there are so few startups compared to large corporations, the sample size of this study is relatively small, which is a limitation for some statistical tests. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Startup should measure and monitor the correct metrics in a particular stage, instead of trying to perform well in all areas, which will lead them to lose focus, and possibly even fail. Results obtained from this study will aid startups in properly monitoring and managing their performance. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
Unlike large corporations, the performance measures used by startups vary, and depend on a startup’s stage and type. Because of the fact that there are much fewer startups than large corporations, there are a limited number of studies in this area. This research is among the first studies that try to investigate the uses of performance measure for this new type of organizations.</data>

Firm performance is measured through productivity, profitability and revenue growth. Structural stability tests and dynamic regression models for panel data are used for the data of 191 banking firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange during 2000-2011.,The paper reveals, contrary to theoretical expectations, that the impact of IC on firm performance is inconsistent during financial crises. This behaviour emerges mainly because of the incapability of human capital, the main component of IC, to create value for the sample firms during financial crises.,The findings of the study are confined to financial crises that existed in the US economy during the period 2000-2011. The findings provide evidence that heterogeneity in the resource base of a firm plays a very minor role in the value creation process during turbulent economic situations. The findings also question the practicality of investing in intangible assets, including IC, during periods of financial crises.,This paper could be the first attempt to evident empirically that the heterogeneity in the resource base of the firm has a very minor role to play in the value creation process when instability exists in the macroeconomic environment.</data>

NeuMAN is based on three important ideas: (1) neural mechanisms perform all requirements for intelligence without symbolic reasoning on finite sets, thus avoiding exponential matching algorithms; (2) the network reinforces hierarchical abstraction and composition for sensing and acting; and (3) the network uses learned sequences within contextual frames to make predictions, minimize reactions to expected events, and increase responsiveness to high-value information.

The design of an MRE-based adaptive tuned dynamic vibration absorber (ATDVA) involves designing two parts: stiffness and mass. Before designing the MRE-based ATDVA, this study determined the resonance frequency of a target object for vibration reduction. For the design of the ATDVA’s stiffness part, the thickness of specimens was determined by measuring the rate of variation of the MRE’s shear modulus with respect to the MRE’s thickness. The design of the mass part was optimized using sensitivity analysis and genetic algorithms after the derivation of formulas for its magnetic field and mass. Further, upon the application of an electric current to the MRE, its stiffness was measured so that the stiffness of the designed MRE-based ATDVA could be tuned accordingly. Finally, the vibration-reducing performance of the MRE-based ATDVA was evaluated to determine the applicability of the vibration absorber under the condition of variable-frequency excitation.</data>

Purpose
This paper aims to look at the problems of measuring the performance of business strategy. The authors look at the problem using two classical performance management paradigms and suggest a third approach which treats strategy as a stochastic network of actors and manoeuvres between those actors.


Design/methodology/approach
This has been developed using action research in a number of strategy projects with a range of organisations in the private, public and third sectors.


Findings
The two normal paradigms in use for performance measurement and management both struggle when applied to strategy. The problems are not merely ones of execution, they are much more fundamental and sit at the level of conceptual design. Modelling strategy as a series of manoeuvres between different actor organisations is both a more useful way to develop strategy but also provides a simple way to develop measures of strategic performance that can tell us not merely whether the strategy is being executed but also whether it is working.


Originality/value
The paper describes a totally new approach to measuring strategy – both its execution and also its effectiveness which contrasts with both the two prevailing paradigms commonly used in the field of strategy.

      <data key="d3">The authors propose a web-based adaptive categorization and authenticated recommendation system, based on teacher performance. Distinct layers of the proposed framework have been operated from many geographically distributed locations. The system contains multiple entry points such as a student attendance module, a teacher categorization module, and a teacher recommendation module, strictly accessed by the administrative authority of an academic organization. The student attendance module is required for achieving better results on the teacher categorization module, and the teacher recommendation module. The reliability factor has been incorporated for realizing the accuracy of the proposed system. The administration authorities communicate with the server to categorize and recommend teachers by using teachers' performance. The replication and re-allocation transparencies have been maintained throughout the servers. Lightweight system performance has been enhanced due to the incorporation of a paperless approach and has provided less data loss. A linear time complexity is achieved due to usage of cellular automata as a tool.</data>

      <data key="d3">Brain functional connectivity is a useful biomarker for diagnosing brain disorders. Connectivity is measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Previous studies have used a sequential application of the graphical model for network estimation and machine learning to construct predictive formulas for determining outcomes (e.g., disease or health) from the estimated network. However, the resulting network had limited utility for diagnosis because it was estimated independent of the outcome. In this study, we proposed a regression method with scores from rs-fMRI based on supervised sparse hierarchical components analysis (SSHCA). SSHCA has a hierarchical structure that consists of a network model (block scores at the individual level) and a scoring model (super scores at the population level). A regression model, such as the multiple logistic regression model with super scores as the predictor, was used to estimate diagnostic probabilities. An advantage of the proposed method was that the outcome-related (supervised) network connections and multiple scores corresponding to the sub-network estimation were helpful for interpreting the results. Our results in the simulation study and application to real data show that it is possible to predict diseases with high accuracy using the constructed model.</data>

      <data key="d3">The tetradecapeptide somatostatin has been implicated as an important regulator of neuronal and neuroendocrine function in the CNS. The cellular actions of somatostatin are mediated by specific receptors. The genes encoding two different somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) have been isolated and characterized, and RNA blotting studies have shown that both SSTR1 and SSTR2 are expressed in the brain. In order to gain a better understanding of the functions of somatostatin in the CNS, the distribution of SSTR1 and SSTR2 mRNAs was determined using the technique of in situ hybridization. SSTR1 mRNA was present throughout the mouse brain, particularly in the supra- and infragranular layers of the cortex, the amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, hypothalamus, pretectum, substantia nigra, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. SSTR2 mRNA was primarily observed in the infragranular layers of the cortex, the amygdala, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, arcuate and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, and medial habenular nucleus. Several regions of the brain reported to contain dense somatostatin-like immunoreactive terminal fields and receptor binding sites were devoid of both SSTR1 and SSTR2 mRNA, suggesting the existence of additional SSTR subtypes.</data>

      <data key="d3">The taxonomic position of a novel bacterial strain, designated C3T, isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated desert sands was determined. Strain C3T was a Gram-stain-negative, rod- to curved-rod-shaped and non-motile bacterium. It was able to grow at 4-45 °C (optima, 28- 35 °C) and at pH 6.1-8.8 (optima, 6.9-7.7). No added NaCl was required for growth of strain C3T and it tolerated up to 3.5 % (w/v) NaCl with optimal growth with 0.5-1.5 %. Catalase and oxidase were positive. C18 : 1ω6c/C18 : 1ω7c, C16 : 0, C12 : 0 aldehyde, C14 : 0 3-OH/iso-C16 : 0 I and C18 : 1ω7c 11-methyl were predominant fatty acids. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine were major polar lipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 65.4 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain C3T represents a member of the genus Shinella within the family Rhizobiaceae of the class Alphaproteobacteria. Strain C3Tshowed a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.39 % with Shinella kummerowiae CCBAU 25048T, 98.37 % with Shinella granuli Ch06T, 98.17 % with Shinella zoogloeoides I-16-MT, 97.74 % with Shinella fusca DC-196T, 97.46 % with Shinella yambaruensis MS4T and &lt;96.68 % with other members of the family Rhizobiaceae. DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain C3T and the type strains of the nearest species were clearly below the 70 % threshold for species delineation. Distinct morphological, physiological and genotypic differences from previously described taxa support the classification of strain C3T as a representative of a novel species in the genus Shinella, for which the name Shinella curvata sp. nov. is proposed.

      <data key="d2">T Teyke; KR Weiss; I Kupfermann</data>
      <data key="d3">The appetitive phase of feeding behavior in Aplysia consists of a behavioral sequence in which the quiescent animal starts to locomote and then assumes a characteristic feeding posture. In this position, head-turning responses can be elicited by a localized food stimulus (seaweed) delivered to the lips or tentacles. In response to brief (open loop) stimulation with seaweed, the animal turns toward the stimulus but greatly overshoots the target. However, the angular velocity and the final turning angle are a function of the eccentricity of the stimulus, progressively increasing with greater eccentricities. In a food-aroused animal, a brief tactile stimulus evokes turning and biting responses similar to those triggered by seaweed, which provides both tactile and chemical stimulation. Upon repeated tactile stimulation, however, the response magnitude decrements rapidly, whereas the magnitude remains high when turning responses are repeatedly elicited by food stimuli. A purely chemical stimulus sometimes can elicit a turning response, but chemical stimuli alone are much less efficacious than tactile stimuli alone. When the stimulus is maintained in a stationary position (closed loop), the animal turns until its mouth is oriented over the food. A turning response to a lateral stimulus can be reduced by an immediately following medial stimulus. To explain the above findings, we propose a form of response substitution, in which the response to the first, lateral stimulus is substituted by a weaker response to a more medial stimulus. No turning response is evoked when the animal is stimulated while performing spontaneous or evoked bites, though biting per se does not interrupt ongoing turning movements. In animals with lesions of the cerebral- buccal connectives, a food stimulus on the mouth is also followed by a reduction of the capacity of stimuli to elicit turning responses. In these lesioned animals, the food stimulus appears to elicit a bite command, though the biting behavior itself does not occur. Thus, it appears that the bite-related gating of stimuli is of cerebral origin, rather than due to the generation of the buccal motor program. The force necessary to power the turning movements was calculated from the trajectories of the movements. The results indicate that a power phase during the first half of the duration of the total movement is sufficient to generate a turn. The power phase can be followed by a brief gliding phase, and finally the movement appears to be actively terminated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</data>

      <data key="d3">In era of big data, the computer vision-assisted textual extraction techniques for financial invoices have been a major concern. Currently, such tasks are mainly implemented via traditional image processing techniques. However, they highly rely on manual feature extraction and are mainly developed for specific financial invoice scenes. The general applicability and robustness are the major challenges faced by them. As consequence, deep learning can adaptively learn feature representation for different scenes and be utilized to deal with the above issue. As a consequence, this work introduces a classic pre-training model named visual transformer to construct a lightweight recognition model for this purpose. First, we use image processing technology to preprocess the bill image. Then, we use a sequence transduction model to extract information. The sequence transduction model uses a visual transformer structure. In the stage target location, the horizontal-vertical projection method is used to segment the individual characters, and the template matching is used to normalize the characters. In the stage of feature extraction, the transformer structure is adopted to capture relationship among fine-grained features through multi-head attention mechanism. On this basis, a text classification procedure is designed to output detection results. Finally, experiments on a real-world dataset are carried out to evaluate performance of the proposal and the obtained results well show the superiority of it. Experimental results show that this method has high accuracy and robustness in extracting financial bill information.</data>

      <data key="d3">Clustering is an important and challenging research topic in many fields. Although various clustering algorithms have been developed in the past, traditional shallow clustering algorithms cannot mine the underlying structural information of the data. Recent advances have shown that deep clustering can achieve excellent performance on clustering tasks. In this work, a novel variational autoencoder-based deep clustering algorithm is proposed. It treats the Gaussian mixture model as the prior latent space and uses an additional classifier to distinguish different clusters in the latent space accurately. A similarity-based loss function is proposed consisting specifically of the cross-entropy of the predicted transition probabilities of clusters and the Wasserstein distance of the predicted posterior distributions. The new loss encourages the model to learn meaningful cluster-oriented representations to facilitate clustering tasks. The experimental results show that our method consistently achieves competitive results on various data sets.</data>

      <data key="d3">

With the rapid development of the civil aviation industry, the number of flights has increased rapidly. However, the availability of flight slot resources remains limited, and how to allocate flight slot resources effectively has been a hot research topic in recent years. A comprehensive flight slot optimization method can significantly enhance the rationality of the allocation results. The effective allocation of flight slot is the key to improving the operational efficiency of the multi-airport system. We will optimize the flight schedule of the entire multi-airport system considering the fairness of each airport in it. The optimization results will provide an important reference for the reasonable allocation of flight slot within the multi-airport system. Based on the operation characteristics of the multi-airport system, we have established a multi-objective flight slot allocation optimization model. In this model, we set the airport capacity limit, shared waypoint capacity limit and aircraft turnaround time limit as the constraints. The optimization goal of the model is to minimize total flight schedule displacement and the maximum deviation of fairness from the absolute fairness. Gurobi solver is used to solve the model. We have innovatively incorporated the rolling capacity constraint method into our model to ensure more accurate flight slot allocation results. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regional multi-airport system is selected as an example to verify the above model, and the flight slot optimization results have successfully met the fairness goal. The comparative analysis has demonstrated that the rolling capacity constraint method significantly improves the accuracy of solution results, leading to more stable flight slot allocation. The results also prove that the flight slot allocation method of multi-airport system based on absolute fairness of peak demand can improve the fairness of the allocation results. To achieve a higher level of fairness, we have found that the peak-demand based fairness method requires a smaller slot displacement compared to the non-peak demand-based method. Through the optimization of flight slot of the multi-airport system, the coordination between airports can be significantly improved. It can provide a new solution for the efficient operation of the multi-airport system.

Purpose
This study aims to examine the relationship between advertisement expenditure and firm performance as well as the moderating effects of firm age and size on this relationship.


Design/methodology/approach
Twenty-eight selected companies listed on the Nigerian stock exchange were examined. The study used multiple regression, a quantitative research method, to capture both the direct and moderating effects.


Findings
The findings show that advertisement has a positive relationship with sales but an insignificant relationship with return on asset. Furthermore, the results indicate that larger firms outperform smaller ones when using advertisements to enhance their sales. On the contrary, there is no significant difference between the use of advertisement by young and older firms in improving financial performance.


Originality/value
Due to the often-wrong use of resource base view in the advertisement–performance relationship and contradiction in research findings, this paper re-conceptualize advertisement as a necessary investment (just like plant and equipment) but not an investment that provide strategic value. The paper also makes novel argument by theorizing a negative relationship between advertisement and firms’ performance in the Nigerian context.

The purpose of this paper is to improve the ability of enterprises to routinely realize peak performance and produce positive social and environmental impact. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
An acknowledged operational excellence model – the one behind the globally recognized Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence – is examined in relation to positive reciprocal behavior and the value of creating and reinforcing processes that “pile good upon good” in form of virtuous improvement cycles. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Embedding virtuous reciprocity cycles in enterprise culture and routines can help to routinize peak performance. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
Only the Shingo Operational Excellence Model is examined so that other well-known alternatives such as the Malcolm Baldrige Performance Excellence Model and EFQM Excellence Model are not examined. That said, the general structure and content of most excellence models is sufficiently similar that the approach taken herein would likely yield analogous conclusions. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Inherent in “practices” is that enterprises seek to routinize successful approaches to performance and impact, usually via contextualized implementation of excellence models or “programs” such as lean enterprise. 
 
 
 
 
Social implications 
 
 
 
 
Offered is one means of creating more positive enterprise cultures. Enterprises with more positive cultures have been shown to also be more productive and to contribute more positively to the fabric of society so that the “piling of good upon good” can extend beyond the borders of the enterprise.

Purpose
When an organization becomes a high performance organization (HPO), it is able to outperform comparable organizations for an extended period of time, thereby ensuring its long-term survival. It is therefore imperative for these organizations embarking on an HPO transformation to be aware of the factors that will help make this transformation successful. Unfortunately the current literature does not provide these factors; one can only find factors influencing large-scale transformations. It could be argued that becoming an HPO is a large-scale transformation, but this leaves the question open whether there are specific factors that are important for this specific type of transformation.


Design/methodology/approach
The purpose of this paper is to answer the research question “What are the main factors which theoretically and in practice best support a successful HPO transformation?” This question was answered using the results of a review of the literature on large-scale transformations and a review on the applications of de Waal’s HPO Framework in practice.


Findings
Eleven theoretical and eight practical success factors were found. These factors matched for 63.6 per cent, indicating there is a moderate overlap between what the theory predicts and what can be noticed in practice. In addition, the practical cases indicated there are two success factors that are specifically important for an HPO transformation.


Originality/value
The study results contribute to the theory, as they show what is and is not important for a specific large-scale transformation such as an organization transforming into an HPO. The practical contribution of the study lies in the fact that organizations now know which factors to pay attention to in order to increase their chances on a successful HPO transformation.

      <data key="d3">Biological invasions have been paid more attention since invasive species may cause certain threats to local ecosystems. When biological control is adopted, selecting control species for effect better becomes the focus of latest studies. A food web system, with one native species, one invasive species as predator, and one introduced control species preying on both native and invasive species, is established based on pair approximation, in which the spatial landscape of biological invasion and control is concerned, and the local and global dispersal strategies of invasive species, in addition to the predation preferences of control species for native and invasive species, are considered. The influence of the initial density and initial spatial structures of the control species is investigated and the effects of control species releasing time are analyzed. Generally, the earlier the species introduction, the better the control effect, especially for invasive species dispersing globally. Interestingly, too low control species predation preference for native species can lead to unsuccessful introduction, while too much predation preference will have a weak control effect. The larger the control species predatory preference for invasive species is, the more conducive it is to biological control. The extinction of the invasive species is closely related to the initial density and concentration of the control species. This study gives some insights on selecting control species, its appropriate releasing time, and the density and spatial aggregation of it. Some real-life examples are elaborated on, which provides references for biological invasion control.</data>

      <data key="d3">Complementary label learning (CLL) is a type of weakly supervised learning method that utilizes the category of samples that do not belong to a certain class to learn their true category. However, current CLL methods mainly rely on rewriting classification losses without fully leveraging the supervisory information in complementary labels. Therefore, enhancing the supervised information in complementary labels is a promising approach to improve the performance of CLL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Complementary Label Enhancement based on Knowledge Distillation (KDCL) to address the lack of attention given to complementary labels. KDCL consists of two deep neural networks: a teacher model and a student model. The teacher model focuses on softening complementary labels to enrich the supervision information in them, while the student model learns from the complementary labels that have been softened by the teacher model. Both the teacher and student models are trained on the dataset that contains only complementary labels. To evaluate the effectiveness of KDCL, we conducted experiments on four datasets, namely MNIST, F-MNIST, K-MNIST and CIFAR-10, using two sets of teacher-student models (Lenet-5+MLP and DenseNet-121+ResNet-18) and three CLL algorithms (PC, FWD and SCL-NL). Our experimental results demonstrate that models optimized by KDCL outperform those trained only with complementary labels in terms of accuracy.</data>

      <data key="d3">Cigarette smoke and hemodynamic stress contribute to inflammatory processes associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial cells are intimately involved in vascular pathology. We recently demonstrated classical pathway complement activation on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and on endothelial cell lines including human bone marrow microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC). Complement components have been identified in atherosclerotic lesions, and complement derived inflammatory mediators likely play a role in vascular injury. Endothelial cells express several complement receptors, including gC1qR/p33. gC1qR/p33 recognizes the globular domain of the first component of complement, C1q, and directly activates the classical pathway. The present study was designed to explore the effects of two known atherosclerotic risk factors, tobacco smoke and shear stress, on classical pathway complement activation on endothelial cells. BMEC were grown to confluence on type I collagen, and treated for 24 hours with tobacco smoke extract (0.015 or 0.03 puffs/ml) from 2R4F research cigarettes. BMEC monolayers, in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% human plasma (anticoagulated with 0.32 % sodium citrate), were exposed to constant shear stress at 18 dynes/cm 2 for 1 hour at room temperature using a cone and plate shearing device (courtesy of Dr. David Varon, BDR Technologies Ltd., Israel).

Purpose
This paper aims to develop a performance measurement (PM) system for fourth-party reverse logistics (RL). In this regard, it proposes simultaneous utilization of a procedural approach and hybrid use of existing performance frameworks.


Design/methodology/approach
The paper first describes fundamentals of RL and PM approaches in literature to build a basis for further discussion. It then carries out a systematic review of the literature on PM in RL to highlight current trends and approaches in this regard. At last, it develops a PM system for fourth-party RL by exploring relevant performance frameworks and by defining a procedure in detail.


Findings
The paper identifies the ongoing interest in development PM in RL, and the gap and the need for the development of comprehensive PM system for fourth-party RL. It also identifies the best approach is to use existing performance frameworks in literature and a procedural approach together as they complement each other rather than contradicting.


Research limitations/implications
The paper fills a gap in literature by developing a comprehensive PM framework for the fourth-party RL. The presented procedure is well suited to be used as part of strategic management process in any fourth-party RL organization. It forces users a top-down approach, from strategies to measures, so that a strong linkage is established in the process. When used together with the proposed PM framework, it guarantees a comprehensive and balanced PM system.


Practical implications
The paper identifies the need for the development of a PM framework as well as a measurement system for the fourth-party RL in the literature. In this regard, it develops a PM framework first, and then a procedure on how to implement it. As a result, users can effectively use them as a part of strategic management process of their organizations.


Social implications
The fourth-party RL is growing and very promising mode of RL for well-being of society, by offering a strong path to sustainable development in the midst of diminishing resources in the world. The existence of a well measurement system is crucial for the healthy operations and development of fourth-party RL organizations. The paper is offering a strong PM model in this regard.


Originality/value
The paper fulfills an identified need to study how to develop a PM system for fourth-party RL.

      <data key="d3">Purpose 
 
 
 
 
This paper makes an attempt to demonstrate the importance of breaking absorptive capacity (AC) into two sequential components, to effectively measure and utilize the construct. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Data on potential AC, realized AC and firm performance were collected utilizing survey questionnaire administered to 284 Indian SMEs operating in the automotive service segment. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
To test the proposed hypotheses, the authors broke AC into its two sequential components – potential AC and realized AC, and tested their linkages with firm performance. The authors not only found the sequential components to be more reliable, but also found better explanation of firm performance. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The findings in this paper have crucial implications for researchers working in the domain of AC and knowledge management. By demonstrating the operationalization of AC as two sequential components, the authors make a case for more effective utilization of the construct in future studies. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This study is among the few research attempts that have tried to create a sequential operationalization of AC. The findings clearly reveal that potential AC is an enabler of the realized AC, which in turn enhances firm performance.</data>

Translating these requirements into the object-oriented models is a tough process for designers. This article proposes a neoteric approach to generate Unified Modeling Language (UML) class models instantly from software requirement specifications (SRS). Here the authors make use of the Open Natural language processing tool (OpenNLP) for lexical analysis and to generate the necessary parts of speech (POS) tags from these requirement specifications. Then, the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) standard is used to extract the object-oriented elements from the natural language (NL) processed SRS. From this, the authors generate UML class models. The prototype tool can generate accurate models in less time. This automated system for designing object-oriented models from SRS reduces the cost and budget for both the designers and the users.</data>

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide a multidimensional understanding of the management of feedback from customer product returns and the management practices that lead to the occurrence of product returns in the context of knowledge management. The characteristics of product returns indicate that to manage them requires specific knowledge management, as the nature of their management is rather complex.


Design/methodology/approach
Understanding of feedback concept for the purpose of product returns avoidance management and its linkages with knowledge management through the theoretical review was performed first. Second, soft systems methodology (SSM) to analyze the very complex situation, as the product returns present, provided the conceptual framework for empirical research. The principles and best practices of SSM were followed and an analysis of documents together with the theoretical knowledge of feedback, product returns and knowledge management served as the basis for the action research.


Findings
The research highlighted the importance of knowledge management (even in a rather simple form) for the solution of the problematic situation and underlined the necessary interconnections between different areas of business processes management and the need to manage knowledge. It also showed that product returns act as important feedback for the whole organization.


Originality/value
This paper is the first attempt to apply current knowledge of the feedback construct into the knowledge and product returns management. It is also the first attempt to apply SSM to product returns management.

      <data key="d3">Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare the performance of corporate acquisitions between the pre- and post-SOX periods, using both short-term and long-term analyses. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The sample includes 9,463 mergers and tender offers undertaken by publicly traded US firms between 1996 and 2009. The authors used the standard event study methodology for short-term performance analysis; Berkovitch and Narayanan (1993) method to identify merger motives; and standard benchmark adjusted return on assets (sales) (Barber and Lyon, 1996) and buy-and-hold abnormal returns (Mitchell and Stafford, 2000) to analyze long-term performance. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Compared to the pre-SOX period, US acquirers experience significantly higher announcement returns in the post-SOX period; the results are robust to various controls like bidder, target and deal characteristics, bidder management quality, and product market competition. Similar results (in favor of post-SOX US acquirers) are obtained with long-term post-acquisition operating and stock performance analyses. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
This paper only addressed domestic acquisitions.

This paper adds to the growing body of research on the impact of SOX on publicly traded US corporations. By examining corporate acquisitions, an important long-term investment decision for a firm, the paper shows that despite the complex nature of SOX, substantial compliance costs and the unintended negative consequence it engendered, the act had a beneficial impact in an important area of corporate finance.</data>

      <data key="d3">Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to test opposing views of the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and stock price crash risk in a major Asian emerging stock market. Design/methodology/approach - This paper suggests an endogenous relationship between CSR and stock price crash risk. Hence, this paper uses two-stage least squares regression analysis to address the bias and inconsistency associated with endogeneity issues. Moreover, previous studies argue that the level of effectiveness of corporate governance significantly affects firm-specific stock price crash risk. Thus, this paper further divides the overall sample into two sub-samples according to the median of the corporate governance index. Furthermore, this paper investigates the impact of CSR on stock price crash risk under corporate governance. Findings - The empirical results show that CSR significantly mitigates Taiwanese stock price crash risk. This finding is consistent with the notion that socially responsible Taiwanese firms commit to a higher standard of transparency and engage in less bad news hoarding, thus reducing crash risk. The empirical results also show that CSR has a more pronounced effect in mitigating crash risk for Taiwanese firms with less effective corporate governance. Originality/value - The study findings indicate that CSR plays a more important role in reducing crash risk for Taiwanese firms with weak governance mechanisms.</data>

      <data key="d2">Brett C. Olsen; Chris Tamm</data>
      <data key="d3">Purpose 
 
 
 
 
Periods of financial distress represent an episode during the firm’s life that requires an effective governance structure in the interests of shareholders. Changes in corporate governance structure are examined as firms approach and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The purpose of this paper is to posit that firms alter their governance toward a more effective framework during restructuring, leading to emergence as a better performing firm. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The data set includes large firms that filed for bankruptcy between 1998 and 2013. Financial and governance characteristics prior to filing are compared to traits following emergence. The likelihood of emerging from bankruptcy is tested based on governance characteristics prior to filing and the change in these characteristics during bankruptcy. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results show that firms use the bankruptcy process to significantly change their governance characteristics. These changes include smaller boards, greater board independence, unitary boards, the separation of the CEO and chairman positions, and changes in the ownership structure. Despite these changes, performance following emergence does not improve, and the changes in governance structure do not alter the likelihood that the firm will emerge. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This study, unlike previous studies, takes a broad look at governance characteristics for firms before and after bankruptcy. The findings imply that “better” governance, as defined in the literature, is not necessarily the pathway to better performance as many posit. The factors that influence the likelihood of emerging from bankruptcy and post-emergence performance require further study.</data>

      <data key="d3">Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address whether the past dividend policy of target firm impacts dividend policies following US mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). Design/methodology/approach - The authors use the catering theory as a theoretical approach to test dividend change after a merger-acquisition. For the empirical design, dividend policy is captured using dividend status, payout ratio and dividend yield, and specifications are estimated using Probit and OLS models. Findings - The data indicate that dividend policy of the target affects dividend policy of the combined entity in cases of stock-based deals. This result provides support for catering theory, which maintains that managers of acquirers adjust dividend policies following transactions to cater to target shareholders’ preferences. Research limitations/implications - Although the tests suggest significant results using dividend status and payout ratio as measures of dividend, the authors do not find a similar effect for dividend yield. Practical implications - Financial analysts evaluating merger-acquisition announcements may wish to predict the dividend policy following stock-based deals as they project the likely impact of past dividend policies of target firms. The results are also likely to be useful to investors. Originality/value - The paper presents new evidence about dividend policy following M&amp;A.

      <data key="d2">Cathy Xuying Cao; Chongyang Chen</data>
      <data key="d3">Purpose - This paper examines how employee satisfaction affects firm value around the financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach - We use the 2008 financial crisis as exogenous shocks to firms to mitigate endogenous concern that employee satisfaction and firm value can be jointly determined. We compare firm value of two groups’ of firms: 1) the firms on the Fortune magazine’s list of “100 Best Companies to Work For” and 2) matched firms that are not on the list. We employ difference-in-difference approaches in our tests. Findings - We find that when the crisis happens, the Best Companies experience larger decreases in firm value than comparable firms. In addition, such decreases in firm value only exist among the Best Companies with high financial flexibility. We also show that job satisfaction alone does not create firm value during the financial crisis; only when interacted with high financial flexibility, employee satisfaction leads to high firm value. Finally, we document that Best Companies do not have any advantage in the recovery of firm value after the crisis, regardless of their level of financial flexibility. Research limitations/implications - There is considerable debate on whether job satisfaction leads to performance or performance leads to satisfaction (Luthans (1998)). We show that the impact of employee satisfaction on firm value changes over time. We also identify a crucial factor that impacts the value-creation of employee satisfaction: financial flexibility. Our findings suggest that the ambiguous results documented in prior literature can be due to the different sample periods and the failure to identify the impact of financial flexibility in previous studies. Practical implications - Our findings provide helpful implications to the business community. Our evidence suggest that to reap the benefits of employee satisfaction, companies need to manage their financial flexibility to buffer against potential negative shocks while having strong corporate governance mechanism to mitigate agency concerns. Moreover, our study provides an investment recommendation to Socially Responsible investment (SRI) and suggests that it is better off implementing dynamic SRI investment strategies according to economic condition. Originality/value - We contribute to the literature by showing that the impact of employee satisfaction on firm value changes over time. Our test design not only allows us to study the effect of employee satisfaction on firm value at a particular point in time, but also helps us examine the variation in the effect over economic cycles.

Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Panel data analysis was applied on a sample of 207 Russian companies that frequently traded in the Russian Trading System during the period 2007-2011, in order to test hypotheses on the relationships between board size, board independence, gender diversity, presence of board committees and financial performance, as measured by Tobin’s Q.

      <data key="d3">Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this paper is to determine if there is a significant difference in the investment risks between small-cap manufacturers that heavily depend on one or a few buyers, referred to as “dependent-buyers,” and small-cap manufacturers that have a more diversified customer base. If there is a significant difference both statistically and economically, then investors need to be aware of the dependent-buyer effect in their security selection and portfolio construction efforts. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Using large samples of firm-level data from 2000 through 2011, the authors employ standard risk estimation modeling to compute βs, idiosyncratic risks, and total risks of both dependent-buyer firms and firms with a more diversified customer base. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The authors find that the βs, idiosyncratic risks, and total risks of dependent-buyer firms are much greater than that of firms not in dependent relationships. These differences are both statistically and economically significant. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
Buyer-supplier relationships can change quickly, and so a firm that has a diversified base in one period, for example, could be a dependent-buyer in the next period. Much depends on the reporting accuracy of firms and the ability of the securities exchange commission (SEC) to track the relationships. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
First, the risk of individual small-cap stocks is likely to be greater than perceived from macro-level data, leading to the need for more securities if idiosyncratic risk is to be eliminated. Second, small-cap investors have the opportunity to enhance portfolio construction efficiency by referencing data published by the SEC. Third, most investors interested in small-cap manufacturing stocks should find it prudent to allocate a large percentage of their small-cap investments to an index fund. While this may sacrifice higher returns, it also reduces the probability of experiencing an unpleasant small-stock effect. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This is the first study to show that the difference in investment risks between small-cap manufacturers that depend on one or a few firms for their outputs and small-cap manufacturers that have a well-diversified customer base is statistically and economically significant, information that should be valuable to investors in their security selection and portfolio construction efforts.</data>

      <data key="d3">Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the relationship between operational risk management (ORM), size, and ownership of Indian banks. This is important in the context of financial crisis experienced by developed countries due to lax regulation. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
ORM practices of Indian banks are proxied by excess capital (over the required minimum capital for operational risk). Size of a bank is measured as deposits plus advances. Our sample includes 61 Indian banks during the period from 2010 to 2013. The authors empirically examine the impact of bank size on excess capital using panel data regression model. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results suggest that size of Indian banks is inversely related to excess capital held by them for managing operational risk. The inverse relationship implies that smaller banks hold higher excess capital over the required minimum as per Basel norms. There is no significant relationship between ownership (public, private and foreign) and excess capital held by banks for managing operational risk. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The study has implications for Indian banks given the high level of losses due to bad loans, and the implementation of Basel III norms by the central bank, i.e. Reserve Bank of India. 
 
 
 
 
Social implications 
 
 
 
 
The study has implications for Indian financial system as a large percentage (about 33 per cent) of household savings are deployed in deposits with commercial banks and other financial institutions. The bank failure(s) can have disastrous consequences for the Indian economy as the capacity of the Indian financial system to withstand such shocks is highly doubtful. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
There is very little evidence on ORM practices of Indian banks, and its relationship with size and ownership. The study assumes significance in the context of significant changes in the institutional and regulatory framework.</data>

Findings 
 
 
 
 
The analysis reveals that while the number of women has increased in general terms, this change is mostly limited to boards that are increasing in size. Women do not tend to replace exiting male board members but are appointed when the board size grows. Therefore, while the number of women is increasing in absolute terms, they are not increasing in relative terms. In areas where religiosity is high, as measured by church affiliation and attendance, female participation in the boardroom is lower and a more educated and qualified female population leads to higher board participation. These effects supersede any regional effects.

      <data key="d3">Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this paper is to investigate volatility spillovers across the interest rate swap markets of the G7 economies, and then the authors investigate whether spillovers of swap markets contain useful information to explain subsequent stock price movements. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
This study uses the short- and long-term swap spread volatility of the G7 countries to explore the spillover effects of international swap markets, and then investigates the relationship between swap and stock markets. The authors use the generalized VAR approach suggested by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) to study spillovers of international swap markets. The Granger-causality tests are employed to examine the linkage of interest rate swap and stock markets. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
This paper shows that a moderate spillover effect exists for the short- and long-term swap markets. Moreover, the results show that the short- and long-term swap markets of France and Germany have a larger impact on other countries’ swap markets than that of other countries’ swap markets on the French and German swap markets. Finally, the results indicate that the total volatility spillovers for the long-term swap markets have a larger influence on the total volatility spillover index of stock markets and the global stock market volatility than that of the short-term swap markets. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
Prior literature has used impulse response and variance decomposition analyses to investigate international swap markets linkages. However, the results depend on the ordering of variables. This study uses the framework of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) to overcome the ordering issue, and thus the authors can compute directional spillovers. This paper is the first study to explore the linkage of the total volatility spillover of swap markets and the stock markets.</data>

      <data key="d3">Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether ownership structure affects earnings management in the banking industry of emerging markets. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The empirical study is conducted using a sample of 134 banks from 12 Middle Eastern and North African countries. Econometrically speaking, the study used a panel data regression analysis. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The authors found convincing evidence that banks with more concentrated ownership use discretionary loan loss provisions to manage their earnings. The authors also found that state and institutional owners encourage earnings management, while family owners reduce this practice. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The findings would be valuable for investors since they should take into account ownership structure in order to reach a better investment decision. Moreover, regulatory reforms in emerging markets should push for more transparency about ownership structure, high levels of supervision, and external audit quality. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This study presents international evidence on the prominent role of owners in earnings management in emerging markets with weak shareholder rights protection.</data>

      <data key="d3">PurposeIntangible capital (IC) is an important factor for economic growth and firm performance. The role IC has played has become even more crucial in recent decades, possibly influencing debt capacity and default risk assessment. This paper studies how entrepreneurial and employee-based IC affects financial leverage.Design/methodology/approachEmployer–employee unbalanced panel data provided by Statistics Finland that refer to Finnish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are used. Intangibles are measured with an expenditure-based method. Employee-based IC and entrepreneurial knowledge are used to explain debt financing in SMEs.FindingsThe findings imply that IC-intensive firms have less debt capacity due to weak pledgeability and asymmetric information between borrower and lender. Entrepreneurs with managerial or financial knowledge increase the firm's debt capacity compared to other entrepreneurs, especially in knowledge-intensive services (KIS). One explanation is that the entrepreneurs are more competent in negotiating with lenders as the entrepreneurs possess better financial skills. Entrepreneurs with technical knowledge decrease the firm's debt capacity in all industries.Originality/valueWhile some earlier research focused on the IC–financial leverage relationship, hardly any study has looked at entrepreneurial IC. This paper provides new insights by including entrepreneurial IC alongside employee-based IC.</data>

      <data key="d2">Kuo-Jung Lee; Jen-tsung Huang; Mei-chun Wu</data>
      <data key="d3">Purpose - In order to follow the international trend of increasing transparency in financial statements, Taiwan began to implement regulations on expensing employee bonuses in 2008, a process that involves the use of specific dates as the basis for issuing the bonuses but which may also have the drawback of resulting in some degree of unfairness. This paper attempts to study and solve the above problem. Design/methodology/approach - The present study used Markov regime-switching models to obtain durations of different states, thereby obtaining average stock durations for use as the basis to calculate the number of shares to be distributed. Findings - Empirical results show that replacing share prices on specific dates with those of average durations when issuing employee bonuses could better reflect employee-deserved real wages while keeping a company’s managers and management teams from being motivated to manage real earnings and manipulate share prices. When stock prices are higher, companies will tend to issue cash rather than stock bonuses, and vice versa when the prices are lower. Originality/value - This study proposes a different point of view with regards to the basis for the allotted number of shares for employee bonuses under current laws and regulations, and suggests using the concept of average stock prices in place of the single-price concept implemented under the current system in order to avoid incentives to manipulate by people, so as to fairly express the true state of the enterprise.</data>

      <data key="d3">Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of earnings forecast revisions by equity analysts in predicting Canadian stock returns. Design/methodology/approach - the sample covers 420 Canadian firms over the period 1998-2009. It analyses investors' reactions to 27,271 upward revisions and 32,005 downward revisions of analysts' forecast for Canadian quoted companies. To test whether analysts' earnings forecast revisions have impacts on stock return continuation, forecast revision portfolios similar to Jegadeesh and Titman (2001) are constructed. The paper analyses the returns gained from a trading strategy based on buying the strong upward revisions portfolio and short selling the strong downward revisions portfolio. It also separates the sample into upward and downward revisions Findings - a) new information in the form of analyst forecast revisions is not impounded efficiently into stock prices. Significant returns persist for a trading strategy that buys stocks with recent upward revisions and short sells stocks with recent downward revisions; b) good news is impounded into stock prices more slowly than bad news; c) post-earnings forecast revisions drift is negatively related to analyst coverage. The effect is particularly strong for stocks with greatest number of upward revisions; d) the introduction of the better disclosure standards has made the Canadian stock market more efficient. Originality/value - This paper adds to the limited evidence on the effect of analyst forecast revisions on the returns of Canadian stocks. It sheds light on the importance of analysts' earnings forecast information and offers support for the investor conservatism and information diffusion hypotheses.

      <data key="d2">Paweł Wnuczak; Dmytro Osiichuk</data>
      <data key="d3">PurposeWhile the existing studies largely suggest that valuation uncertainty benefits acquirers, who apply discounts to targets' value attributable to information asymmetry, the authors argue that the opposite may be the case.Design/methodology/approachThrough multivariate econometric analysis of transaction data, the authors establish the link between the degree of valuation uncertainty measured by targets' track of public listing and acquisition premia. The authors use text-mining tools to measure acquirer–target similarity and control for its role in intermediating the posited empirical relationships.FindingsHaving analyzed 618 acquisitions involving listed targets from China, the authors find that acquirers pay higher valuation premia for the more recently listed and relatively younger companies than for those with a longer history since floatation. Similar patterns apply to valuation multiples. Higher valuations are partially attributable to premia for control, as acquirers are likelier to buy a majority stake in the recently listed firms, especially if the latter are similar to them. Such transactions take less time to complete and involve a transfer of larger share blocks despite the higher degree of information asymmetry and a frequent lack of targets' operational profitability. The authors also observe a significant premium for target–acquirer similarity: acquirers appear to rush deal completion due to possible overestimation of targets' potential and familiarity bias.Originality/valueThe authors show that acquisition premia may be driven by acquirers' proclivity to place risky investment bets on the growth potential of opaque targets. This pattern may partially explain frequent failures of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).</data>

      <data key="d3">Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the operational efficiency and effects of market concentration and diversification on the efficiency of Chinese and Indian banks in the 1997-2011 period. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs the two-stage bootstrap procedure of Simar and Wilson (2007) to obtain valid inferences on the efficiency scores and the efficiency determinants. Findings - Using data set for each country separately, the authors found that the bias-corrected cost efficiency displays an upward trend in Chinese and Indian banks. This trend is consistent with profit efficiency among Chinese banks, but the trend is unclear in Indian banks. Market concentration is negatively related to cost and profit efficiencies of Chinese banks. However, market concentration is positively associated with cost efficiency, but unrelated to profit efficiency of Indian banks. In Chinese banks, diversification of revenue, earning assets and non-lending earning assets are associated with increasing profit efficiency, but their effects to cost efficiency are not clear. In Indian banks, diversification of earning assets increases profit efficiency while there are cost efficiency losses from diversification of revenue and earning assets. Practical implications - Bank regulators and supervisors in China should consider establishing policies to reduce market concentration and encourage diversification of revenue, earning assets and non-lending earning assets, while increasing concentration and diversification of earning assets should be encouraged in Indian banks. Originality/value - To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study employing the double bootstrap procedure proposed by Simar and Wilson (2007) which can address the problem of the two-stage data envelopment analysis or SFA estimator in the efficiency literature on Chinese and Indian banks that efficiency scores obtained in the first stage are inter-dependent, and hence violating the basic assumption in regression analysis in the second stage.</data>

      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of pre-acquisition earnings management on the performance of private firm management buyouts.


Design/methodology/approach
The study examines 291 UK private firms acquired by their managers between 2004 and 2012. Earnings management is investigated by means of cross-sectional discretionary accruals models, and estimated discretionary accruals are regressed on performance changes in the three years following acquisition.


Findings
Management buyouts of private firms are preceded by earnings overstatement and followed by performance deterioration. Private equity sponsored firms engage less in earnings management and remain more profitable than non-sponsored buyouts. Upward earnings managers cease to outperform industry after second post-buyout year, while aggressive earnings managers do not outperform industry at all. Discretionary total accruals are inversely associated with performance changes in the three years after buyout, and explain over 4 per cent of the changes in performance.


Research limitations/implications
Pertinent to the utilisation of private firms and their exemption from publishing cash flow statement, the study relies on accrual-based models for tests of earnings management.


Originality/value
The paper contributes to the mergers and acquisitions literature and value creation debate in buyouts by providing the first tests of earnings management and post-acquisition performance in private firm management buyouts.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of acquisitions on the number of shareholders of the acquirer (the shareholder base) and relate that effect to the method of payment and the ratio between the target’s and acquirer’s shareholder bases prior to the acquisition.


Design/methodology/approach
Using 348 acquisitions from 1993 to 2013 for which both parties are public, American firms, the paper measures changes in the acquirer’s shareholder base from before announcement through to four years after completion. OLS regressions, together with an instrumental variables approach addressing the endogeneity of acquisition payment, indicate the determinants of those changes.


Findings
Acquisitions completed partly or entirely in stock lead to large increases in the shareholder base, and the increases mostly endure over the four-year window examined in the study. Regression results indicate that the target to acquirer shareholder ratio has a much greater impact on the acquirer’s base for stock acquisitions than for cash acquisitions. The ratio is also associated with changes in beta.


Practical implications
Because existing theoretical and empirical literature shows that the shareholder base impacts the risk, liquidity, and market value of stock, managers evaluating potential targets and modes of payment may wish to consider the likely impact on their firms’ shareholder bases, as may investors contemplating the effects of an acquisition announcement.


Originality/value
This is the first work documenting both a short- and long-term impact of acquisitions on the shareholder base and the first to investigate the determinants of the change in the base.

      <data key="d3">Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of financial literacy, risk attitude, and saving motives on the attenuation of mutual fund investors’ disposition bias. Specifically, the authors focus on individual characteristics explaining the investors’ propensity to sell shares in a poorly performing mutual fund. Design/methodology/approach - The study relies on survey data collected from 1,564 Swedish households in 2013. The authors test the hypotheses considering three different portfolio compositions and portfolio performances. Each composition corresponds to a dependent variable and a separate model which are estimated using ordinal logistic regression. Findings - The authors find that different forms of financial literacy affect attenuation of the disposition effect. Specifically, the authors find that knowledge about mutual funds and knowledge about current market conditions affect the attenuation of the disposition effect, whereas the authors find no support for the effect of “technical financial knowledge” (e.g. the ability to calculate compound interest rates). The authors also find no support for the effects of risk attitude and saving motives on the attenuation of the disposition bias. Originality/value - The findings suggest a need for a more fine-grained conceptualization of the financial literacy concept and its effect on investors’ disposition bias.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the emergence of blockchain to determine its feasibility for electronic transfer payments. An integrated conceptual framework is developed for blockchain electronic transfer. The three “markers” of classic money (store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account and efficiency) are assessed in the case of blockchain technology. A survey is also conducted among the executives of financial vs manufacturing sectors with respect to five major variables for the emerging distributed financial data based on blockchain.


Design/methodology/approach
Conducting a literature review and using prior knowledge from the works of those well-versed and knowledgeable in the field. This research is also supported by collecting and analyzing the results of a behavioral survey of the executives in two different industries.


Findings
Blockchain technology has the potential to have widespread change in how firms operate and implement a new method for electronic payments transfer through cryptocurrencies. Although the community for blockchain technology is deregulated and has drawbacks, it is expected that the limitations will gradually be mitigated through its growth. The results of the behavioral survey show that there are significant differences between the expectations/perceptions of participants in the sectors of finance vs manufacturing. Namely, the knowledge/awareness of participants about blockchain, the value-added convenience for end users, and participants’ willingness to embracing and accepting new applications are significantly different between the two sectors.


Originality/value
The reach and applications for Blockchain are not limited to business or any particular sector. Blockchain technology may contribute to the operations of different types of organizations and industry sectors. Since the perception of participants about blockchain is different between selected industries, this research suggests the need for more education and building awareness among the participants in different sectors of the economy.

This study examines U.S. stock market returns over this period from 1926 through 2014. We find that returns are generally higher during the period and that the effect is considerably stronger for small firm portfolios relative to large capitalization portfolios. We also provide convincing evidence that the three most important trading days (especially for small stock portfolios) are the last trading day in December and the first two trading days in January. Our results are supported by parametric and non-parametric tests. Design/methodology/approach - We examine the Santa Claus Rally by relating it to firm size in the stock markets of the United States. The Santa Claus Rally consists of the last five trading days in December and the first two in January. We use t-tests, non-parametric test and regression analysis to determine if investors in small firms get superior returns over the period 1926-2014. Findings - We find that returns are generally higher during the period and that the effect is considerably stronger for small firm portfolios relative to large capitalization portfolios. We also provide convincing evidence that the three most important trading days (especially for small stock portfolios) are the last trading day in December and the first two trading days in January. Research limitations/implications - We only check the markets in the USA. Market makers can use this to get significantly high returns during the Christmas-New Year period. Our study shows for the first time that there is a size effect as part of the Santa Claus Rally. Practical implications - 1. This is the first study to show that Santa Claus Rally exists for a long time in the USA. 2. It is the first study to show that there is a size effect in Santa Claus Rally - 3. Market participants could get significantly higher returns by investing or being invested in the stock market during this period.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the interactions between free float and stock liquidity in the UK stock market over the period 2002–2016.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper is conducted using cross-sectional data regression analysis. The sample consists of 15,650 firm-level observations from the UK stock market.


Findings
The findings suggest that stocks with higher levels of free float are associated with higher levels of liquidity. This relation is significant regardless of the liquidity measure used, and is evident even after controlling for firm characteristics.


Originality/value
This paper contributes to the existing literature by presenting further evidence on the significance of free float in capital markets and its effect on stock liquidity, particularly for UK firms as the minimum free float requirements as announced by the FTSE group in 2011 increased from 15 to 25 percent.

Purpose
There is some evidence that firms appoint internal candidates to exploit their unique firm specific knowledge and that the type of appointments may have signaling value to the market. However, these studies are limited to chief executive officer appointments whereas other top executives could also play an important role in corporate decision making. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the chief financial officer (CFO) appointments and firm’s debt-equity choice.


Design/methodology/approach
The authors employ a multiple regression framework. To control for potential endogeneity, the authors use an instrumental variable approach with both two-stage least squares and generalized method of moments estimators.


Findings
The authors find that firms with internal CFO hires issue more equity than firms that hire from the external labor market. The authors also find that internal CFOs significantly reduce information asymmetry (IA), which may lower market risk and the cost of financing through equity issues. Furthermore, consistent with the value maximizing role of reduced IA the authors find that this effect is concentrated in value firms. In firms with higher IA this preference for equity by the internal CFO may be weaker as even internal CFOs will prefer debt financing for its disciplining role and to reduce IA. A subsample analysis with growth firms shows this diminishing impact on the financing choice of an internal CFO.


Originality/value
This study provides important information about the influence the CFO has on a firm’s capital structure decisions.

      <data key="d3">PurposeThis study aims to examine the financial literacy level among the Omani adults and investigate the determinants of financial literacy and its impact on savings and investment behavior.Design/methodology/approachThe data were collected using a survey instrument adopted from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) survey for financial literacy and composed of 310 individuals' responses. The authors used a multiple regression analysis to determine the impact of the socio-demographics variables on the financial literacy level.FindingsThe findings are three-fold: first, financial literacy score of Omanis is 10.5 out of 21, which is lower than OECD average. Interestingly, the attitude and behavior scores are in line with the OECD average. However, the knowledge score is drastically lower. Second, financial literacy level is found to be affected by age, gender and the monthly income. Third, individuals with a higher level of financial knowledge are more likely to have monthly savings and investment in stock and bond.Research limitations/implicationsThe Gulf countries have started to modernize their economies.

      <data key="d3">PurposeThe study aims to investigates which form of classification shifting is preferred by firms to avoid the violation of debt covenants and whether the higher-audit quality constraints the shifting practices of firms incentivized to avoid covenant violations or not.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 1,644 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)-listed firms during the period 2009–2021 has been used in this study and tested through panel data regression models. Two forms of classification shifting, namely expense shifting and revenue shifting have been taken into account. The findings are validated through the propensity-score matching technique.FindingsThe findings deduced from the empirical evidence demonstrate that firms prefer revenue shifting over expense shifting to avoid covenant violations, consistent with the notion of the ease-need-advantage-based shifting framework, where firms are found to prefer a shifting tool with greater relative advantage. Further, the author finds that superior audit quality has a constraining effect on expense shifting, but not on revenue shifting, indicating the partial effectiveness of high-quality auditors in curbing the corporate misfeasance of classification shifting.

      <data key="d3">Purpose This paper aims to study the level of financial literacy of entrepreneurs across the globe and its role in financial access and performance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) based on a systematic review. The present study identifies the measures to enhance the level of financial literacy for increasing financial access and performance of enterprises.Design/methodology/approach Systematic literature review has been undertaken by identifying 358 studies from various sources. After removing the 237 studies based on selection criteria, 67 studies have been found relevant for the present study.Findings The level of financial literacy of entrepreneurs around the world is generally low. It has been found that financial literacy improves performance of an enterprise, particularly when the funds are readily available as insufficient funds disrupt the operating efficiency of the firm, thereby hindering its growth and survival. The other most important factors i.e. access to formal finance, lending policies of financial institutions, ease of doing business and training programmes have a substantial influence on the survival of the firms. The literature also revealed that there is no standardised methodology to measure the financial literacy of entrepreneurs.Research limitations/implications The study conceptualises a research model which can be used by the policymakers to develop training modules for entrepreneurs. These training modules will contribute to the nation’s economic growth by virtue of enhanced performance and superior financial access.Originality/value This study proposes a hypothesised research model which is one of its kinds to demonstrate the influence of financial literacy on financial access and performance of MSMEs.</data>

      <data key="d3">PurposeThe existing literature, generally based on US data, provides little evidence that supports whether managerial ability directly links to corporate risk-taking. Hence, this study aims to expand the limited extent by investigating the impact of managerial ability on risk-taking across Saudi firms.Design/methodology/approachThis study mainly uses a panel fixed-effects model, including firm-year and firm-industry, to analyse a sample of Saudi non-financial firms from the period 2008 – 2018. In the empirical analysis, the managerial ability is lagged by one year to mitigate endogeneity concerns that may arise from reverse causality. To avoid omitted variables bias, this study includes several firm-level control variables.FindingsThe empirical results show that the relationships between managerial ability and firm risk-taking measures are negative and statistically significant with the standard deviation of return on assets (sROA) and leverage; positive and statistically significant with the Z-score. These results indicate that firms managed by high-ability executives have the propensities to take less risk. The main results remain robust to additional sensitivity analyses including an alternative measure for managerial ability, an alternative proxy for risk-taking using logistic regression analysis, using financial crises as dummy variables, and using a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects for endogeneity concerns.Practical implicationsWhen evaluating firms, all market and society participants including researchers, regulators, supervisors, policymakers, and boards ought to pay close attention to managerial ability as one of the main factors affecting risk-taking.Originality/valuePreviously, closely related studies, focussing on the US market, mainly find that managers with high ability are receptive to risk-taking.

      <data key="d3">Purpose - This paper aims to revisit the extant evidence on gender bias in the market. Specifically, it revisits reaction to CEO announcements. Also, it explores whether the development of the bias over time and by firm size aligns with existing theory. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines cumulative abnormal returns around CEO announcements from 1992 through 2016 using a modified event study methodology. This evidence shown examines market reactions over time and by firm size. Findings - Financial markets react more favorably to male CEO announcements, with a cumulative abnormal return of 49 basis points above the reaction to their female counterparts. Moreover, the paper finds that market reaction varies over time, which may be because of the increasing proportion of female CEOs, and by firm size, which may be due to the differences in new information available to investors. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include sample size due to the paucity of female CEO announcements. This paper does not examine the effect of industry, detailed CEO characteristics or announcement content on market reaction. In addition, using an extended event window may increase the likelihood of capturing confounding events, such as mergers or earnings announcements, which limits the interpretability of the results. Practical implications - Gender bias in financial markets creates another institutional barrier for the advancement of female professionals, as well as implies inefficient capital allocation in markets. Originality/value - The literature in this field is still inconclusive. Furthermore, bias development over time and the effect of information on bias remain unexplored.

      <data key="d3">PurposeThis study explores whether exposure to macroeconomic information provides bellwether firms with information advantages at the macroeconomic level and facilitates managers to utilize such informational advantage for investment decision-making. The author tests whether firms' macroeconomic exposure is associated with sensitivity of their segment-level investments to growth opportunities and how internal and external frictions affect this association cross-sectionally.Design/methodology/approachThis study follows prior research to identify high-macroinformation firms and measures the level of macroexposure based on how closely the firms' underlying business varies with macroeconomic conditions. The main specification is a segment-level regression of investment on growth opportunities and an interaction between growth opportunities and the level of macroeconomic exposure.FindingsThe results indicate a significantly positive association between firms' macroeconomic exposure and sensitivity of segment-level investments to growth opportunities, suggesting that bellwether firms can leverage their greater exposure to macroeconomic and external information to improve the quality of their investment decisions. Further evidence shows that this positive association is decreasing in firms' corporate diversification level and is also decreasing in their foreign operation level, implying that internal and external frictions could limit the information benefits ultimately gained by firms from their macroeconomic exposure.Originality/valueAccounting researchers have recently documented evidence that bellwether firms' management earnings forecasts convey timely information about macroeconomic states, suggesting that managers of certain types of firms are likely to have private macroeconomic information.

      <data key="d3">PurposeThe corporate finance literature has largely treated individual managers as uniform entities, leaving unexplained the large heterogeneity in corporate practices. The authors explore whether educational background attributes, such as a bachelor's degree from an elite institution and the field of study, influence CEO management style manifested in objectively measurable outcomes at the firm level.Design/methodology/approachThe authors construct a unique data set from various sources. The management-style variables encompass investment, financial, organizational strategy policy choices, and performance outcomes. They standardize the style variables by industry sector and express deviations from industry means into three categories (low, medium, high). The ordered logit models suggest that educational background attributes influence management style across several dimensions.FindingsThe authors document numerous statistically and economically significant results. For instance, an elite education translates to superior market performance as measured by Tobin's Q. A background in science/technology manifests in more (less) spending on R&amp;D (advertising) and less exposure to financial risk for the firm. The authors also find that gender plays almost no role, while CEO age has a nonlinear influence role in affecting management style.Research limitations/implicationsThe study posits that educational background plays an important role along several dimensions such as skill and character development, signaling and network building. While these effects are difficult to disentangle, they all arguably influence an individual's ability to perform complex tasks such as running a company.Originality/valueThe paper contributes to the growing literature on the drivers of CEO style and performance. Previous studies have examined the role of a CEO's elite educational background on firm performance outcomes and have reported either no or limited association.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of spin-off announcements on the parent firm’s share prices. Also, it is studied that during which period the announcement impacts the share prices significantly thereby affecting the shareholder wealth.


Design/methodology/approach
A sample of 76 Indian firms has been taken which announced the spin-off of their one or more divisions during 2010–2011 to 2015–2016. The authors have used the event study methodology with an event window period of −35 to +35. Estimation window of 256 (−290, −35) days is considered in the study.

      <data key="d3">PurposeThe authors analyze the relationship between exchange rate fluctuations of a number of major currencies and its impact on US stock market returns, as proxied by the S&amp;P 500. Many studies have explored this topic since the early 1970s with varied results and with no evidence that clearly explains the relationship between exchange rates and stock market returns. This study takes a different look at this hypothesis and investigates the pairwise relationship between various exchange rates and the United States stock market returns (S&amp;P 500 INDEX) from January 2000 to December 2019.Design/methodology/approachThe authors test the data for unit roots using Phillip-Perron method. They use Johansen cointegration model to determine whether returns on S&amp;P 500 are integrated with S&amp;P 500. They use the VAR/VECM analysis to test whether there are any interdependencies between exchange rates and stock market return. Finally, they use various GARCH models, including the EGARCH and TGARCH models, to determine whether there exist volatility spillovers from exchange rate fluctuations in various markets to the volatility in the US stock market.FindingsUsing GARCH modeling, the authors find volatility in Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and the euro impact market return, and the volatility of Australian dollars and euro spills over to the volatility of S&amp;P 500. They also find that the spillover is asymmetric for Australian dollars.Research limitations/implicationsOne of the limitations could be that the authors use different bivariate GARCH models rather than the MV-GARCH models. For future project(s), they plan to do this analysis from the perspective of a European Union or a British investor and use returns in those markets to see the impact of exchange rates on those markets. It would be interesting to know how the relationship will change during periods of financial crises. This could be achieved by employing structural break methodology.Originality/valueMany studies have explored the relation between stock market returns and exchange rates since the early 1970s with varied results and with no evidence that clearly explains the relationship between exchange rates and stock market returns.

      <data key="d2">Khaled Elkhal</data>
      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of the relationship between business risk and financial leverage. While past theoretical and empirical studies on this topic use similar variables, overall, their findings are inconclusive. In this paper, the author contends this is partially due to inappropriate proxies for business risk that are commonly used in these research papers. To correct for this misspecification, this paper proposes an alternative proxy for business risk that is isolated from the effects of financial leverage.


Design/methodology/approach
Past research on the relationship between business risk and financial leverage uses some variations in a firm’s operating cash flow as a proxy for business risk. This proxy cannot solely reflect business risk and may very well be affected by the level of financial leverage, especially for financially distressed firms. This paper proposes an alternative proxy for business risk that is isolated from the effects of financial leverage. This proxy is the cost of capital of an all-equity firm. The theoretical model developed in this paper is based on deriving the optimum level of debt as a function of business risk in the context of the Modigliani and Miller Proposition II model.


Findings
The findings show a positive linkage between business risk and financial leverage. This relationship is robust to the various forms the cost of financial distress function may take.


Originality/value
The mixed findings in past research papers regarding the relationship between business risk and financial leverage are mainly due to “inappropriate” measures of business risk that do not only reflect one firm attribute and are contaminated with other factors mainly financial leverage. As such, since the variable of interest is misspecified, the outcome of these studies cannot be credible. This paper attempts to correct for such misspecification by proposing a proxy that only reflects business risk. In addition, the proposed model is based on the widely acceptable Modigliani and Miller static theory of capital structure.

      <data key="d2">Amir Saadaoui; Kais Saidi; Mohamed Kriaa</data>
      <data key="d3">This paper aims at looking into the transmission of shocks between bond and oil markets using a bivariate GARCH (BEKK and DCC) model. As lots of financial assets have been exchanged due to these index returns, it is essential for financial market participants to figure out the mechanism of volatility transmission through time and via these series for the purpose of taking optimal decisions of portfolio allocation. The outcomes drawn reveal an important volatility transmission between sovereign bond and oil indices, with great sensitivity during and after the subprime crisis period.,In this context, we propose our hypotheses. Indeed, our study aims to see whether the financial crisis has been responsible for the sharp drop in oil prices since October 2008. To this end, we suggest, in this paper, the empirical study of the shock transmission between the bond and oil markets, using BEK-GARCH and DCC models. To our knowledge, this is the first document using the BEKK-GARCH and the DCC models in studying the shock transmission between a sovereign bond and oil indices.,We have noticed that in the event of a disruption in the bond market, oil prices respond to these shocks in the short term. It has also been emphasized, however, that this relationship has exacerbated if the period has extended. This makes us conclude that the financial market situation affects the oil price only throughout the crisis period; and that this situation is causally significant only in the event of a severe crisis, such as those of subprime and sovereign debt.,The global financial system has been going through an acute crisis since mid-2007. This crisis, initially occurred only in the US real estate market, progressively affects the global financial system, and is now becoming a general economic crisis. The objective of this work is to analyze the effects of the current financial market disturbance on oil prices based on econometric models in order to promote the proper functioning of this study.</data>

      <data key="d3">The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the link between institutional ownership stability and dividend payout ratio.,First, the authors estimate the propensity of a firm to pay dividend. Next, the authors perform panel fixed-effect regressions of dividend payouts on institutional ownership stability variables.

The authors analyze the dividend preferences of different types of institutional owners. Finally, the authors examine the cross-sectional variation in the volatility of dividend payouts.,The authors find that stable and large institutional owners favor dividend paying companies. There also exists a positive association between ownership persistence and dividend payout. Conversely, firms that change their dividend payout frequently are associated with larger deviations in institutional ownership. Additionally, the presence of pressure-sensitive institutional investors (i.e. investors that also hold business ties with the investee firm) is significantly linked to dividend payout policy. Conversely, pressure-insensitive investors use alternative forms of monitoring instead of requiring investee firms to pay dividends, which serve to reduce agency conflicts.,This paper considers the preferences of long-term stable institutional investors in their selection of dividend paying firms.</data>

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to critically review the relevant literature from the perspective of dual-class firms and to provide suggestions for future research on dual-class firms, and on methodological issues that should be addressed in such research.


Design/methodology/approach
The research design consists of three parts: an introduction to dual-class firms (motivations for; firm life cycle effects) in Part 1; concerns with firms with such share class structures (valuation; governance; accounting and corporate policy issues) in Part 2; and some solutions or ways to accommodate the trade-offs involved with such share class structures (retention arguments; index/exchange exclusions; contractual provisions; external monitoring) in Part 3. Throughout the paper, the authors provide some critiques of existing studies, particularly from a methodological perspective, the authors’ opinion on the state of the literature and suggestions for future areas of research.


Findings
While motivations for the use of dual-class voting structures include flexibility so that the idiosyncratic vision of their entrepreneurs/founders can be pursued in a less encumbered fashion, greater innovation and long-term managerial orientation, there are many possible costs (e.g. underinvestment and managerial entrenchment) to this ownership structure. Nevertheless, the authors believe that such firms should have provisions in place that facilitate a reversion to a single-class structure longer term when such firms have become more mature, less dependent on the idiosyncratic vision of the entrepreneurs/founders at IPO and have attracted more managerial talent.


Originality/value
The literature arrives at no consensus on the benefits/drawbacks of this type of share ownership structure which means that many topics of research require further academic examination. The authors provide suggested directions for such future enquiries.

      <data key="d3">PurposeThe authors aim to examine the relationship between home bias and globalization while specifically examining the effects of the different dimensions of globalization (social, economic and political) for both developed countries and developing countries. Additionally, the authors test the effect of globalization regulation and laws against actual globalization activities.Design/methodology/approachThis study investigates the influence of globalization on the home bias phenomenon using a panel regression and a three-dimensional globalization index (social, economic and political globalization) of 42 developed and developing countries from 2001 to 2016.FindingsThe results show that globalization significantly reduces home bias. In addition, the authors find that social globalization has a key influence compared to economic globalization and that political globalization has the weakest effect. For developing economies only, economic globalization as well as globalization laws and regulations have a crucial impact on the level of home bias.Originality/valuePrior studies focus merely on the aspect of financial integration. Our study provides a more comprehensive outlook by distinguishing between the features of globalization (social, economic and political) as well as the actual globalization activities (de facto) compared to the laws and regulations enabling those actives (de jure). Lauterbach and Reisman (2004) show that globalization reduces home bias through a theoretical model. This study provides empirical merit to their work.

      <data key="d3">PurposeAmid growing attention from investors, regulators and advisory firms in recent years, this study assesses whether managers exploit private information to time share-pledge transactions and extract personal benefits while avoiding unintended market scrutiny.Design/methodology/approachWe use hand-collected pledging data for a random sample of S&amp;P 1500 firms to examine whether private information influences insider share-pledging activity using Heckman selection and two-part hurdle models of the pledge decision. We also conduct an event study analysis of announcement returns to measure market reactions to pledging news and determine whether share-pledge disclosures affect investor risk assessments.FindingsConsistent with insiders timing pledges prior to anticipated performance declines, both the likelihood and level of pledging increase significantly with negative earnings surprises. New share-pledges precede significant decreases in abnormal returns, and public announcement of new pledging corresponds with significant negative cumulative abnormal returns. The evidence suggests that insiders exploit private information to time pledges, and that investors update risk assessments and value estimates based on information conveyed by these transactions.Practical implicationsOur findings hold important implications for governance and regulation of pledged shares, indicating that permissive reporting requirements in the US facilitate informed pledging and may undermine incentive alignment between managers and shareholders. The analysis promotes transaction-specific disclosures and transparent corporate policies for insider share-pledging.Originality/valueOurs is among the first empirical analyses of share-pledging in US firms and the first to examine the role of private information in pledging decisions. We offer novel evidence on the opportunistic use of pledged shares and provide insight to predictors of share-pledging behavior.</data>

      <data key="d2">Mohammad Alsharif</data>
      <data key="d3">PurposeThis study aims to extend the literature by simultaneously investigating the relationship between risk, efficiency and capital in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) dual banking system.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs the simultaneous-equation modeling technique with a three-stage least square estimator on 60 listed GCC commercial banks from 2005 through 2018.FindingsAlthough GCC Islamic banks are more capitalized and liquid, they are riskier and less efficient than GCC conventional banks. Moreover, a higher level of capital reduces the insolvency and credit risk of GCC banks for both types of banks. However, it enhances the cost efficiency of GCC conventional banks only. GCC conventional banks also exhibit skimping behavior, while for GCC Islamic banks, cost efficiency is negatively associated with bank risk. This implies that the risk-taking behavior in Islamic banks is prompted by the incentives of the shareholders following the risk-sharing nature of Islamic banking.Originality/valueThis study differs from previous studies in many aspects. First, it relies on a recent long data set that covers the implementation of the accords of Basel II (introduced in 2004) and Basel III (introduced in 2010). Second, it estimates the efficiency of GCC banks based on separate frontiers for Islamic and conventional banks, ensuring the robustness of the results. In conclusion, to the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the intertemporal relationship between risk, efficiency and capital in the GCC dual banking industry.</data>

The system generalised moment (GMM) estimator (Blundell and Bond, 1998) is used in the dynamic panel.FindingsThe results estimated from the system GMM model show a threshold effect in the ESO–value creation relationship.

      <data key="d3">PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to measure the effect of superstar gig workers, defined as independent contractors who are the most successful in their field, on shareholder value. Gig workers comprise as much as 33% of the workforce and are projected to exceed 50% by 2028. Thus, understanding their impact on shareholder value is important.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses OLS regression analysis. To establish causality regarding wealth effects, the sudden deaths of superstar gig workers are used. To facilitate the uncontaminated measurement of wealth effects, sudden deaths that coincide with a significant event on a [−3, 3] window about the death event are not used.FindingsThe sudden death of a superstar gig worker causes shareholder wealth to increase significantly by 0.35% or almost $1.5m. Rational and behavioral explanations are offered for this result.Research limitations/implicationsGeneralizability is limited because data on superstar gig workers in traditional corporations are unavailable. For this reason, this paper uses the only available data, namely, data on superstar wrestlers, who are contracted to perform in matches (i.e. “gigs”) in a lucrative promotion (e.g. World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)).

Various machine learning and statistical methods are employed to identify the optimal bond rating prediction model. The data cover 8,346 bond issues from 2009 to 2019.FindingsThe authors find that industry concentration, sales, operating leverage, operating efficiency, profitability, solvency, strategic ownership, age, firm size and firm value play an important role in rating non-financial firms. Operating efficiency, profitability, strategic ownership and size are also relevant for financial firms besides additional determinants related to the capital adequacy, asset quality, management efficiency, earnings quality and liquidity (CAMEL) approach. The authors find that random forest outperforms logit and other machine learning methods with an accuracy rate of 92 and 91% for non-financial and financial firms.Practical implicationsThe study identifies important determinants of bond ratings for both non-financial and financial firms.

      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of gender diversity on the boardroom and in top management positions on the risk profile (RP) of acquiring banks.


Design/methodology/approach
To estimate the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) in the RP of the acquirer, the authors will use the same methodology adopted by Vallascas and Hagendorff (2011), this method compares the variation of the RP of the acquirer to the level risk of control banks. To investigate how merger-related risk changes are affected by gender diversity, the authors use a linear regression.


Findings
The results show that, on average, bank mergers do not significantly affect the RP of the acquiring bank. However, the authors found that the proportion of women in the board standing reduces the RP of the acquiring bank. Overall, the authors observe evidence that the appearance of a female in top management is associated with lower bank risk. Moreover, the authors conclude that the relationship between the presence of at least three women on the board and the default risk of the acquiring bank is negative.


Originality/value
This finding suggests that in the M&amp;A transactions, female directors are considerably more conservative than their male counterparts. Thus, the authors confirm the postulate that women are more risk averse and less overconfident than their male counterpart. The conclusions are of particular significance for the banking industry. The authors provide some support for the view that regulators should favor gender quotas in the board management of banks to reduce risk-taking behavior.

      <data key="d1">2019</data>
      <data key="d2">Gurmeet S. Bhabra; Jacob Rooney</data>
      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the strength of corporate governance and the value of firm-level investment policies following the passage of the Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002 and the associated changes to the listing requirements of major stock exchanges. In particular the authors seek to examine potential changes in the market’s assessed value of capital expenditures after the passage of the SOX Act relative to before.


Design/methodology/approach
The authors employ a difference-in-difference methodology, centred on the year of the passage of the SOX Act to test for the role of governance on the marginal value of capital expenditures. Excess stock returns are calculated by subtracting Fama and French (1993) size and book-to-market portfolio value-weighted returns from the firms’ annual stock returns. Each firm is grouped into one of 25 size and book-to-market portfolios for each year in the sample, with size and the book-to-market ratio proxying for sensitivity to common risk factors in stock returns (Fama and French, 1993).


Findings
The authors find that markets responded to the change in governance brought about by the new regulation by altering the value of firm-level capital expenditures in a way that is generally consistent with predictions of agency theory. While the overall findings imply a reduction in agency conflicts post-SOX, there is some evidence that certain firms may have suffered excessive costs of compliance, while still others saw managers become excessively risk averse.


Research limitations/implications
The study has implications related to the efficacy of legislation. Cross-sectional variation in the effect of SOX on the marginal value of capital expenditures suggests that one-size-fits-all legislative approach can have both expected as well as unintended consequences. The study limits its analysis to examining the impact of three significant provisions of the Act. While, the value implications of the Act are largely captured by the selected three, a more comprehensive study could expand on the set of provisions studies to obtain a more granular level impact.


Practical implications
This research should add to the growing body of the literature examining the effect of SOX on firms’ real activities and decisions, as well as contribute to the debate on whether the Act was beneficial or costly to firms. With particular reference to the impact of capital expenditure on firm value, the research contributes to the sparse literature examining the contribution of capital expenditures to firm value and the role that agency conflicts play in this relationship. Additionally, this research adds to the growing body of the literature that examines the costs and benefits of the sweeping new regulations brought on by the adoption of SOX.


Social implications
Given the importance of investment policy for economic productivity and growth, the insights provided by findings in this research should benefit lawmakers both within the USA as well as in countries where corporate misconduct and fraud is a concern.


Originality/value
This is the first study that examines the impact of the SOX Act on the way capital markets value firm-level investment in capital expenditures. Since use of corporate resources by managers is fraught with agency conflicts, the role of SOX in potentially alleviating this conflict as revealed by the tests in this study are very valuable.

The sample period is 2003–2020. It runs a linear panel regression to measure the impact of Economic Policy uncertainty on the optimism level of analysts' forecasts and recommendations, controlling for firm fixed effects. Further, the impact of the SEBI Research Analyst Regulation, 2014, has been assessed with the help of the difference-in-difference approach.FindingsThe Economic Policy uncertainty is significantly and positively related to the analyst optimism, reflected in the forecast bias and recommendation in the Indian context. The experience of analysts and the age of the firm positively drive optimism. However, introducing the Research Analyst Regulation by SEBI led to a decline in analyst optimism. The regulation decoupled the analysts' compensation from brokerage service transactions. Thus, the results suggest that the regulation has effectively curbed the incentive to produce optimistic output.Originality/valueThis is the first study in the Indian market to assess the impact of uncertainty on analyst output. It also investigates the effectiveness of the first analyst-specific regulation in India, i.e. The Research Analyst Regulation, 2014.</data>

      <data key="d2">Dong H. Kim</data>
      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to explore whether share ownership structure plays a role in determining the ex-day pricing of dividends. If share ownership structure, specifically the proportion of the firm’s stock held by individuals vs institutions, has an effect on the ex-dividend day stock price behavior, the ex-day premium is expected to be different for firms with different ownership structures.


Design/methodology/approach
To investigate whether the ex-day pricing of dividends is affected by the proportion of the firm’s stock held by individuals vs institutions, the author look into the ex-day premium. The ex-day premium is calculated by dividing the difference between the closing price on the cum-dividend day and the closing price on the ex-dividend day by the amount of the dividend.


Findings
Consistent with both the tax-based theory and the dynamic trading clientele theory, the author find that the ex-day premium decreases with the level of individual ownership. Consistent with the short-term trading theory, the author also find that the ex-day premium increases with the degree of investor heterogeneity, defined as the product of the proportion of the firm’s stock held by individual investors and the proportion held by institutional investors.


Originality/value
The author believe that this study contributes to the literature by providing useful evidence that share ownership structure affects the ex-day pricing of dividends, and thus this study will be of interest to the readers of managerial finance.

      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determiners to create and destroy value in horizontal mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) using accounting indicators supposed to influence the new entity’s value.


Design/methodology/approach
Using a sample of 90 French listed companies and stepwise regression method, the authors test eight accounting indicators supposed to influence the new entity’s value.


Findings
To create value after a horizontal M&amp;A, it is necessary to concentrate on turnover and the restructuring of charges without neglecting the control of debt capacity. To avoid destroying value after a horizontal M&amp;A, it is necessary to concentrate on the control of debt capacity and restructuring of charges in order to reduce financial charges and financial risk. Horizontal M&amp;A also create value through the reduction of investment costs and through tax optimization.


Research limitations/implications
This paper is different from other contributions in that the majority of existing literature concerning the sources of value creation in M&amp;A has been based on abnormal returns or microeconomic data. This paper analyzes accounting data that are likely to be influenced over the long term by corporate decision making. These kinds of decisions influence the firm’s value as well as the long-term gains that industrial investors may hope to obtain.


Originality/value
This study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature insofar as it seeks to divide the sources of value creation into three categories: sales synergy, cost synergies and hybrid synergies. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is also the first study to provide explanations from companies’ accounting data, which can lead managers to a greater vision of post-merger strategy management, reinforcing the mechanism for value creation.

Die Silva de sirenas von A. Valderrabano von 1547 enthalt eine Fantasia sobre la entrada di una baxa, die bereits Grove nachweist1. Hier scheint, dem Wortsinn intrare = hineingehen entsprechend, eine einfachste Bedeutung des Terminus Intrada in Erscheinung zu treten als Eingang, Einsatz einer Stimme. In diesem Sinn verwenden noch heute die Italiener den Terminus Entrata fur Stimmeinsatze in Fugen. Auch Rousseau2 kennt den Terminus Entree in derselben Bedeutung. In der Sammlung des Valderrabano tritt bereits auch eine erweiterte Sinngebung auf, in der Bedeutung Eingang nicht nur mehr einer Stimme, sondern eines Stucks als Ganzes, und mehr, als Vorspiel zu diesem Stuck. Morphy3 bringt aus dieser Sammlung eine Diferencia zum Soneto A monte sale el amor mit der Anweisung: „Otra diferencia del mismo soneto. La entrada se toccara despacio". Diese Diferencia beginnt mit einem Vihuelavorspiel, das die Melodie der Singstimme vorausnimmt und diminuiert. Hier meint also Entrada den Beginn des ganzen Stucks, der sich formal bereits zu einem Vorspiel geweitet hat, das sich durch langsameres Tempo vom ubrigen Text abhebt und zugleich der Singstimme als Intonation dient. In diesen drei Bedeutungen, als Stimmeingang, Stuckbeginn und intonierendes Vorspiel, wird uns der Terminus Intrada in Spanien und Portugal bis ins 18. Jahrhundert vornehmlich zu beschaftigen haben. Diese drei Sinngebungen werden zugleich die Inhalte der Begriffe Intrada (deutsch), Entrata, Intrata (italienisch), Entree (franzosisch), Entry (englisch) klaren helfen, denen allen der Ursinn „hineingehen" in irgendeiner Gestalt zugrunde liegen bleibt. Wir wollen zugleich festhalten, das dieses fruhestbekannte Auftreten des Begriffs in Verbindung mit diminuierender, d. h. homophon gerichteter Stimmvariation, nicht mit streng imitierender Polyphonie statthat, einer Satzweise, der die Intrada als intonierendes Vorspiel haufig nahebleiben wird. Solche Entradas wird der Vihuelist, wie jeder Instrumentalist jedes Landes, bei diesen wie ahnlichen Gattungen zumeist improvisiert haben, so das wir sie auch da werden voraussetzen mussen, wo sie in den Sammlungen der Milan, Valderrabano, Venegas usw. nicht notiert sind, oder da namentlich kennzeichnen mussen, wo sie etwa vorhanden sind, ohne ausdrucklich genannt zu sein.

      <data key="d1">2021</data>
      <data key="d2">Kim Ee Yeow; Sin-Huei Ng</data>
      <data key="d3">PurposeAs investors' expectations shift toward corporate sustainability, many corporations have jumped on the bandwagon of being “green” by issuing green bonds. However, as a recent green financing tool, little attention has been paid on the value that green bonds actually deliver. This causes the problem of greenwashing, in which firms pretend to be environmentally responsible when in reality they are not. This study therefore aims to explore green bonds' impact on issuers' corporate environmental and financial performance.Design/methodology/approachThe sample is collected from among the green bond and conventional bond issues between 2015 and 2019 issued by corporations from various countries. Using the propensity score matching (PSM) and then difference-in-difference (DiD) approaches, two sub-groups (green bond and conventional bond issuers) were generated for comparison. Changes in environmental and financial performance over time between the sub-groups are then examined.FindingsThe overall results show that green bonds are effective in improving environmental performance, but only when they are certified by third parties. Additionally, green bonds do not have an impact on financial performance. The findings imply that green bonds' dependency on external certification may be a consequence of an underdeveloped green bond market, where weak governance still dominates the green bond market. Because of this, corporations tend to take advantage of green finance's growing popularity, causing the greenwashing problem.Originality/valueGreen bonds are an extremely new area of research. Few research studies focus on the effectiveness of green bonds in impacting corporate financial and environmental performance. Therefore, this study strives to fill this research gap. It sheds light on the effectiveness of green bonds in supporting the development of green projects and provides a reference point for decision-making in strengthening transparency and accountability in environmental disclosure and helps regulating authorities develop tighter regulatory controls.</data>

      <data key="d3">
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to focus on issues of corporate control around the announcement of the decision of Hertz Global Holdings to relocate its corporate headquarters from New Jersey to Florida in 2013. The relocation decision and accounting irregularities discovered after the announcement raised interest from activist investors. The firm responded by enacting a “poison pill,” but control was eventually wrestled away and the CEO was replaced. Examining these events gives students insights into corporate control issues facing a major US corporation.


Design/methodology/approach
This case study presents a history of the firm from its founding in 1918 through 2017, with an emphasis on key events from 2012 through 2017. These events include acquisition of a competing firm (Dollar Thrifty), relocation of corporate headquarters, accounting irregularities, restatement of financials, activist investor responses, issuance of a “poison pill,” and turnover in the CEO position.


Findings
The case is intentionally written to “tell the story” of events that relate to issues involving control of the company around the decision to relocate its corporate headquarters. The case highlights potential agency problems between management and shareholders and the market’s response to those problems.


Originality/value
No prior case study considers the topic of corporate control from the perspective of Hertz Global Holdings. This case study can be used by instructors in graduate and undergraduate courses to examine corporate control issues from a “real world” perspective.

The authors also compare the hedging performance of in-sample and out-of-sample analyses.Design/methodology/approachFor the modeling purpose, the authors combine the GARCH-BEKK model with the machine learning approach to predict the transmission of shocks between the financial markets and the oil market. The authors also examine the hedging performance in order to obtain well-diversified portfolios under both Financial Stress cases, using a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) model.FindingsAccording to the results, the in-sample analysis shows that investors can use oil to hedge stock markets under positive Financial Stress. In addition, the authors prove that oil hedging is ineffective in reducing market risks for bond markets. The out-of-sample results demonstrate the ability of hedging effectiveness to minimize portfolio risk during the recent pandemic in both Financial Stress cases. Interestingly, hedgers will have a more efficient hedging performance in the stock and oil market in the case of positive (negative) Financial Stress. The findings seem to be confirmed by the Diebold-Mariano test, suggesting that including the negative (positive) Financial Stress in the hedging strategy displays better out-of-sample performance than the in-sample model.Originality/valueThis study improves the understanding of the whole sample and positive (negative) Financial Stress estimates and forecasts of hedge effectiveness for both the out-of-sample and in-sample estimates.

The authors report that the relationship between dividend changes and subsequent earnings changes is different for different life stages. They also find that changes in the amount of the dividend provide some information about future earnings, especially during the early (introductory and growth) stages.

      <data key="d3">PurposeThe study aims to empirically analyze whether financial literacy can improve the financial behavior of individuals in the context of emerging markets like India.Design/methodology/approachThe authors use the nationally representative Financial Inclusion Insights survey conducted in India during 2018 for the analysis. The authors consider the financial literacy score based on the standard financial literacy quiz that includes understanding basic numeracy, interest rates, inflation and diversification concepts to study its effect on payment attitude, savings attitude and risk management behavior proxied by insurance uptake. Using an instrumental variable approach, the authors account for the possible endogeneity associated with the financial literacy variable.FindingsThe authors find that less than 9% of individuals have correctly answered questions capturing all four aspects of financial literacy. The analysis suggests that improvements in financial literacy scores indeed increases the likelihood of exhibiting superior financial behavior. The results are robust to alternative definitions of financial literacy, outcome variables and inclusion of additional controls. The authors find that financial literacy increases financial planning, and this, in turn, possibly improves financial behavior. The effects are prominent for those residing in the urban area and having confidence in their financial skills.Originality/valueThis is among the few studies that provide insights regarding how improvements in financial literacy can improve financial behavior in an emerging economy context.

      <data key="d3">As the era of 5th Generation (5G) networks is dawning, several pertinent issues associated with the improvements that have to be achieved in future communications are attracting increasing research attention. This work, considered achieving energy efficiency for 5G at base stations level. Energy efficiency simply means using less energy to perform the same task thereby, eliminating energy waste. The objective of this paper is to examine the ways of deploying energy efficient hardware at the base stations in order to make the base stations more green energy based. Considering the current energy concerns, base stations in emerging wireless networks range from low-energy BSS to high-energy BSS with entirely different constraints in either case. In view of these extremes, this paper examines the major components behind energy-efficient wireless communication network design during the peak and off-peak traffic periods. It was discovered that the Power amplifier consumes up to 59% of the energy at the base stations. Improving a Power amplifier by bringing linearity could improve the efficiency of the BS and hence reduce the energy crunch at the BS level from 59% to 51%.</data>

      <data key="d2">Amedeo Columbano; Hisashi Shinozuka</data>
      <data key="d3">Liver cell growth can be induced in two distinct patterns: compensatory regeneration and direct hyperplasia. In the former, DNA synthesis is preceded by a loss of liver cells such as seen after partial resection of the liver or cell necrosis, whereas in direct hyperplasia, DNA synthesis is stimulated without cell loss. During the past decade, considerable advances have been made in understanding molecular mechanisms of the compensatory regeneration. There is increasing evidence that hepatocyte proliferation induced by some primary mitogens is mediated by patterns of growth factor modulation and signal transduction different from those of compensatory regeneration. Indeed, whereas activation of transcription factors such as NF‐κ and increased expression of immediate early genes such as c‐fos, c‐jun, egr‐1, and c‐myc are induced during compensatory regeneration, such changes are not observed during hyperplasia induced by certain primary mitogens. In addition, although experimental evidence suggests a critical role for growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor and transforming growth factor‐α for the progression into cell cycle of competent hepatocytes in compensatory regeneration, these growth factors do not appear to play a major role in direct hyperplasia. One class of primary mitogens may trigger their actions through tumor necrosis factor‐α, and the other by activation of nuclear hormone receptors. The differences in molecular events observed between liver regeneration and direct hyperplasia may affect differently the initiation step of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Whereas the former supports initiation by chemicals, the latter does not. A similar lack of effect on promotion of carcinogen‐altered cells has also been observed after acute treatment with some primary mitogens. Definition of the mechanisms by which primary mitogens stimulate liver cell proliferation may elucidate the nature of the signals responsible for triggering the entry into cell cycle. Furthermore, due to their low toxicity, primary liver mitogens could have significant clinical applications in gene transfer and liver transplantation.—Columbano, A., Shinozuka, H.

In this study, we introduce a method of conveying emotions through a robot arm while it simultaneously executes main tasks. This method utilizes the null space control scheme to exploit the kinematic redundancy of a robot manipulator. In addition, the concept of manipulability ellipsoid is used to maximize the motion in the kinematic redundancy. The “Nextage-Open” robot was used to implement the proposed method, and HRI was recorded on video. Using these videos, a questionnaire with Pleasure–Arousal–Dominance (PAD) scale was conducted via the internet to evaluate people’s impressions of the robot’s emotions. The results suggested that even when industrial machines perform emotional behaviors within the safety standards set by the ISO/TS 15066, it is difficult to provide enough variety for each emotion to be perceived differently. However, people’s reactions to the unclear movements yielded useful and interesting results, showing the complementary roles of motion features, interaction content, prejudice toward robots, and facial expressions in understanding emotion.</data>

Such Legendrian submanifolds are equipped with additional geometric structures that come from the central moments of the underlying probability distributions and are invariant under the action of the group of affine transformations on V. We investigate the action of this group of affine transformations on Legendrian submanifolds of V×V*×R by giving a detailed overview of the structure of the algebra of scalar differential invariants, and we show how the scalar differential invariants can be constructed from the central moments. In the end, we view the results in the context of equilibrium thermodynamics of gases, and notice that the heat capacity is one of the differential invariants.</data>

      <data key="d3">In this work, oxygen vacancies were introduced onto the surface of BiFeO3 nanoparticles by NaBH4 reduction method to yield oxygen-deficient BiFeO3−x samples. Comprehensive analysis on the basis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) confirms the existence of surface oxygen vacancies on the BiFeO3−x nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared BiFeO3−x samples was evaluated by the decolorization of rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sunlight irradiation. The experimental results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of samples is highly related to the NaBH4 reduction time, and the BiFeO3−x sample reduced for 40 min exhibits the highest photocatalytic efficiency, which is much higher than that of pristine BiFeO3 nanoparticles. This can be explained by the fact that the surface oxygen vacancies act as photoinduced charges acceptors and adsorption sites suppress the recombination of photogenerated charges, leading to an increasing availability of photogenerated electrons and holes for photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the obtained BiFeO3−x sample exhibits good photocatalytic reusability.</data>

      <data key="d3">Viral pathogens often exploit host cell regulatory and signaling pathways to ensure an optimal environment for growth and survival. Several studies have suggested that 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an intracellular serine/threonine kinase, plays a significant role in the modulation of infection. Traditionally, AMPK is a key energy regulator of cell growth and proliferation, host autophagy, stress responses, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial homeostasis, fatty acid β-oxidation and host immune function. In this review, we highlight the modulation of host AMPK by various viruses under physiological conditions. These intracellular pathogens trigger metabolic changes altering AMPK signaling activity that then facilitates or inhibits viral replication. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the regulation of AMPK signaling following infection can shed light on the development of more effective therapeutic strategies against viral infectious diseases.</data>

      <data key="d3">Deglaciation in high mountain areas signifies the transition from glacial to periglacial conditioned landscapes. Due to the reduced melt rate of debris-covered glacier ice, these areas of the glacier may persist long after the surrounding glacier has melted, resulting in the formation of distinct post-glacial landforms. In this study, we examine the geomorphological evolution and potential future development of a 19,267 m3 ± 204 m3 rockfall from the permafrost-affected headwall on the low-elevated Zwieselbachferner in the Horlachtal, Stubai Alps, Austria. The analysis uses multi-epochal remote sensing data, including photogrammetrically and airborne laser scanning-derived digital elevation models, orthophotos, and satellite data, covering a period from the initial rockfall in 2003/2004 to 2022. The data reveals that the rockfall event resulted in the formation of a supraglacial debris layer of varying thickness, spanning an area of 15,920 m2. Subsequently, 13 further rockfalls ranging from 67 m3 ± 6 m3 to 4250 m3 ± 121 m3 were detected. The mean ice thickness of the debris-covered area only slightly decreased between 2006 and 2022, in contrast to the surrounding glacier, whose thickness and length have strongly decreased. This results in the formation of a steep front and flanks that become increasingly covered by debris redistribution. The study suggests that the glacier ice covered by rockfall-derived debris will remain as a periglacial landform of glacial origin after the complete melting of the surrounding glacier.</data>

      <data key="d3">The evolution of water governance and societal perception in large, public irrigation systems in developing countries has triggered successive waves of reforms since the 1980s. Among them are Participatory Irrigation Management, Irrigation Management Transfer, Public-Private Partnerships or Market Instruments. Reforms have generalized the implementation of Water Users Associations (WUAs) in continuous interaction with a public Irrigation Agency. This paper set out to review recurrent problems and reported solutions in the governance of irrigated areas in developing countries and to relate solutions to problems in a case study context. The combination of literature review and the experience of the authors permitted identification and characterization of eight problems and eight solutions. A semi-quantitative approach was designed to relate solutions to problems in case study WUAs. The approach is based on the definition of a generic problem-solution matrix and a WUA-specific problem vector. The solution vector indicates the adequacy of each solution to a case study WUA. It can be obtained by multiplying the problem vector with the problem-solution matrix. Application of this approach to seven case study WUAs demonstrated its potential. Local fine-tuning of the coefficients defining the problem-solution matrix seems required to draw conclusions effectively guiding decision-making.</data>

      <data key="d3">Writing skills are important skills that must be learned to express one's thoughts and ideas. Therefore, several strategies were used in writing classes to enhance learners' writing skills, one of which is collaborative writing. A number of studies reported many advantages for this strategy in terms of the quality of the produced texts and the improvements in students' writing skills. The present study aimed at investigating the attitude of Saudi female EFL learners toward collaborative writing and the challenges/problems that may arise during the activity. It adopted a quantitative approach in which 50 Saudi female EFL learners answered a questionnaire about their experience in writing collaboratively and the problems they encountered during the activity. The findings have shown that the learners have a positive attitude toward collaborative writing. However, there were some problems in terms of students’ behavior, assessment and time management. These findings encourage writing teachers to use this strategy in their classes. In addition, the findings encourage teachers and researchers to address the problems reported in the study.</data>

      <data key="d1">2016</data>
      <data key="d2">S. Q. M. Tighe</data>
      <data key="d3">Sahni et al. make very sensible points about the use of spinal anaesthesia for day-case knee arthroscopy [1], in light of Ambrosoli et al.’s paper [2]. As a past President of Regional Anaesthesia UK, I am very keen to promote the use of regional anaesthesia. However, I do not promote regional anaesthesia where I feel that the risk/benefit is, in general, not in favour of the technique. Most patients having day-case knee arthroscopy are young and fit. They present a minimal risk for general anaesthesia and local anaesthetic infiltration into the joint, which results in excellent postoperative analgesia and rapid uncomplicated discharge from hospital. The alternative of having two needles, one in the hand and one in the back, with the associated risks of painful insertion, intra-operative discomfort or even pain (because of the low dose or short acting techniques required), postdural puncture headache, falls, urinary retention, hypotension, neuropraxia, paralysis and even cardiac arrest and death, does not bear rational comparison, other than in exceptional circumstances. For these reasons, I would not consent for a spinal anaesthetic for day case knee arthroscopy myself, or a peripheral regional anaesthesia technique, and I would therefore be surprised if more than a very few properly informed, rational ASA 1/2 patients would do so either. The facts that so many patients do consent for these techniques as described in the numerous publications, and do so routinely in many institutions, makes me question the validity of the consent processes employed. There are reputably financial advantages in promoting theatre efficiency, but even these are questionable. Spinal anaesthesia has a 5% failure rate. This means that up to 1 in 20 patients will either have a prolonged spinal induction followed by conversion to general anaesthesia, or intra-operative conversion to general anaesthesia. Every time this happens, all the efficiency advantages are lost. General anaesthesia fails far less frequently in this patient group and induction takes &lt; 5 min. The fact that patients receiving general anaesthesia spend a few more minutes in recovery is irrelevant to theatre turnover, as this time is not a limiting factor. Even if there are financial advantages, for example by using a block room to get round the former problems, I have grave doubts that this justifies the means. Spinal anaesthesia is a very useful technique and the indications for its use in ambulatory surgery have increased hugely with newer shorter-acting agents. This has undoubtedly allowed many more patients to benefit from day surgery and there will still be several fit young patients who will choose it, even when rational and fully informed. However, it is inappropriate to use it indiscriminately for the majority, just as it is unreasonable to use any single anaesthetic technique for everyone. Patients must be given a fully informed choice of the options available and that choice must be respected.</data>

      <data key="d3">Abstract. Alpine rivers have experienced considerable changes in channel morphology over the last century. Natural factors and human disturbance are the main drivers of changes in channel morphology that
modify natural sediment and flow regimes at local, catchment, and regional
scales. In glaciated catchments, river sediment loads are likely to increase due to increasing snowmelt and glacier melt runoff, facilitated by climate change. Additionally, channel erosion and depositional dynamics and
patterns are influenced by sediment delivery from hillslopes and sediment
in the forefields of retreating glaciers. In order to reliably assess the
magnitudes of the channel-changing processes and their frequencies due to
recent climate change, the investigation period needs to be extended to the
last century, ideally back to the end of the Little Ice Age. Moreover, a
high temporal resolution is required to account for the history of changes
in channel morphology and for better detection and interpretation of related
processes. The increasing availability of digitised historical aerial images
and advancements in digital photogrammetry provide the basis for
reconstructing and assessing the long-term evolution of the surface, in
terms of both planimetric mapping and the generation of historical digital
elevation models (DEMs). The main issue of current studies is the lack of information over a longer
period. Therefore, this study contributes to research on fluvial sediment
changes by estimating the sediment balance of a main Alpine river (Fagge) in a glaciated catchment (Kaunertal, Austria) over 19 survey
periods from 1953 to 2019. Exploiting the potential of historical
multi-temporal DEMs combined with recent topographic data, we quantify 66 years of geomorphic change within the active floodplain, including erosion,
deposition, and the amounts of mobilised sediment. Our study focuses on a
proglacial river that is undergoing a transition phase, resulting from an
extensive glacier retreat of approximately 1.8 km. This has led to the formation of new channel networks and an overall negative cumulative
sediment balance for the entire study area. We found that high-magnitude
meteorological and hydrological events associated with local glacier
retreats have a significant impact on the sediment balance. The gauge record
indicates an increase in such events, as well as in runoff and probably in
sediment transport capacity. Despite this, the sediment supply has declined
in the last decade, which can be attributed to a lower contribution of the
lateral moraines coupled to the channel network and less sediment sourced
from the melting Gepatsch Glacier as evidenced by roches moutonnées
exposed in the current/most recent forefield. Nonetheless, we observed
significant erosion in the tributary, leading to the transport of sediment
downstream. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the complexity of sediment dynamics in proglacial rivers across various spatial and temporal scales and their relationship to climate change factors.

      <data key="d3">The median survival for patients diagnosed with Glioblastoma (GBM) is only 14 months, due to recurrence, despite current treatment options of surgery, radio- and chemo-therapies. Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) are thought to underlie disease recurrence and lethality as they exhibit self-renewal, multipotency and tumorigenesis. The epigenetic regulation of BTSCs are relatively un-characterized and unlike genomic mutations are potentially reversible. Disrupter of telomeric silencing-1-like (DOT1L) is the only known histone methyltransferase responsible for histone-3-lysine-79 methylation (H3K79me), an epigenetic mark associated with active gene transcription. Previous studies investigating the therapeutic implications of targeting DOT1L in cancer have shown that its inhibition in leukemia results in cancer cell death and, in solid cancers, decreases metastasis. We investigated the role of DOT1L in GBM BTSCs. We find that short-term DOT1L inhibition in BTSCs in vitro has limited effects on viability but alters growth morphology, as neurospheres become flattened and adherent. Furthermore, inhibition decreases BTSC invasion and promotes differentiation. Long-term inhibition of DOT1L had a more pronounced effect on sphere morphology and decreased BTSC proliferation and survival. Pre-treatment with the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676 followed by orthotopic xenografts of BTSCs led to slowed tumor growth and improved overall survival. Initial H3K79me2 ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing results show that H3K79me2 levels and gene expression are decreased for stem and progenitor cell markers SOX2 and OLIG2 respectively, in BTSCs treated with EPZ-5676. These results suggest that DOT1L may be an important regulator of GBM cancer stem cell properties and tumor progression. Current studies aim to further investigate how DOT1L regulates BTSCs by overlaying H3K79me2 ChIP-sequencing, RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing in a panel of BTSCs following DOT1L inhibition and overexpression. These findings highlight the potential clinical implications of epigenetic targeted therapies for GBM. Citation Format: Danielle Bozek, Xiaoguang Hao, H. Artee Luchman, Samuel Weiss.

      <data key="d3">Background
Clinical utility of donor-derived, cellfree DNA (dd-cfDNA) in transplantation has been extensively reviewed, supporting its use as a surveillance tool for the early and accurate detection of allograft injury. Yet studies comparing different assay methods have been lacking.


Methods
Paired sampling of commercially available dd-cfDNA (AlloSure and Prospera) was compared and examined against histology and manufacturer guidance. A total of 76 patients were prospectively assessed, with 11 biopsy sample-proven rejections (antibody-mediated rejection, n=2; T cell-mediated rejection, n=9).


Results
Prospera demonstrated larger measurements of dd-cfDNA in comparison with AlloSure, but this was NS (P=0.12). At current manufacturer recommended diagnostic cutoffs, there was no significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, or positive predictive value of AlloSure versus Prospera in detecting rejection. AlloSure demonstrated a significantly shorter turnaround time (P=0.01) from blood draw to patient result.


Conclusions
Although dd-cfDNAs are similar, they are not the same. Extensive evidence for dd-cfDNA interpretation remains the key to building clinical utility when considering clinical implementation, and remaining consistent to a single platform is important when creating data comparisons.</data>

      <data key="d3">In the last few years, jargon, such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), have been ubiquitous in both popular science media as well as the academic literature. Many industries have tried the current suite of ML and AI algorithms with various degrees of success. Mineral processing, as an industry, is looking at AI for two reasons. First of all, as with other industries, it is pertinent to know if AI algorithms can be used to enhance productivity. The second reason is specific to the mining industry. Of late, the grade of ores is reducing, and the demand for ethical mining (with as little effect on ecology as possible) is increasing. Thus, mineral processing industries also want to explore the possible use of AI in solving these challenges. In this review paper, first, the challenges in mineral processing that can potentially be solved by AI are presented. Then, some of the most pertinent developments in the domain of ML and AI (applied in the domain of mineral processing) are discussed. Lastly, a top-level modus operandi is presented for a mineral processing industry that might want to explore the possibilities of using AI in its processes. Following are some of the new paradigms added by this review. This review presents a holistic view of the domain of mineral processing with an AI lens. It is also one of the first reviews in this domain to thoroughly discuss the use of AI in ethical, green, and sustainable mineral processing. The AI process proposed in this paper is a comprehensive one. To ensure the relevance to industry, the flow was made agile with the spiral system engineering flow. This is expected to drive rapid and agile investigation of the potential of applying ML and AI in different mineral processing industries.</data>

      <data key="d3">Modes have historically been at the centre of music until the end of the Renaissance period, and were ignored for a while with the tonal system in the Baroque period and afterwards. However, in the contemporary period, with the search for new music, they started to gain popularity again and continued to be used as major and minor tonalities. Modes, which have their own unique interval structure, have a different sound scale and feeling compared to major and minor tonalities. For this reason, it takes some time for students who have tonal sensation and practice habits to learn and understand the modes. In many written sources, the concept of mode is explained by associating it with the major scale degrees. This way of expression increases the possibility of making mistakes because it is an indirect way. In this study, it is aimed to present a different approach to the teaching of modes, and examples of the way to be followed are given.  Article visualizations:</data>

It is a term used to describe the 20th-century resurgence of 19th-century ideas associated with free-market capitalism. The typical policies associated with neoliberalism include free trade, globalization, privatization, and changes in government spending to stimulate the private sector. This paper aims to better understand the reasons for this neoliberal turn in higher education and explore the visible and invisible ramifications of this paradigm shift in the policies for higher education in India. The paper focuses on the origins and meaning of neoliberalism, its application and practice in higher education, as well as the issues and critiques that have been raised in this context. The author offers both a critique of the neoliberal paradigm of marketized education and a challenge to academics to act as public intellectuals, both individually and with civil society organizations, to establish a counter-hegemonic discourse to neoliberalism for higher education. The paper concludes that neoliberal education reforms have made higher education much more diverse and have given rise to more learning opportunities; however, in India, which has enshrined systemic inequalities, neoliberalism has further reinforced existing inequalities, and public universities have lost their autonomy and led to knowledge capitalism.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d2">Martha Georgiou; Marina Pandi</data>
      <data key="d3">In recent decades, the increased use of digital games by students at all education levels has attracted the attention of many researchers interested in the effect games used in the classroom have on learning. Despite the strong interest internationally in the use of educational games in the teaching of Biology, in Greece the degree of corresponding research is limited. The purpose of our research is to examine the effect that games have on Greek high school students’ acquisition and retention of knowledge relating to genetics concepts. The sample consisted of 32 K-9 students, who were divided into two groups. In the first group, the chosen teaching approach was based on the traditional teaching method, while in the second group, it was based on the use of an educational genetics card game. All students completed the same assessment test both before and immediately after the teaching interventions. Based on the results, it was found that both approaches yielded statistically similar learning outcomes, with students in the group taught by the game-teaching approach performing better on average than those in the control group.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">The school as a microcosm of the society in which it is situated is as diverse as the society. Heterogenous classrooms pose a challenge to teachers. Teachers have to work hard to overcome the challenge posed by teaching learners with diverse learning needs. Overcoming this challenge calls for teachers to be creative, dexterous, and innovative in applying differentiated instruction. The study sought to investigate basic school teachers understanding and use of differentiated instruction. The study adopted a descriptive survey research design. A stratified sampling technique was used to sample 95 basic school teachers, comprising 44 private school teachers and 51 public school teachers. Data was collected using Differentiated Instruction Assessment Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results indicated that teachers who participated in the study did not have a good knowledge of differentiated instruction and its application in classrooms. Most of the teachers had not attended workshops and in-service training on differentiated instruction. With respect to the use of pre-determined teaching strategies, it can be concluded that teachers do not mostly employ such strategies in their classrooms. The study recommended that teachers are trained through in-service training and workshops on differentiated instruction and its application, as well as using multiple teaching strategies in teaching learners with diverse needs.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d1">2023</data>
      <data key="d2">L. Listyani; Andrew T. Thren</data>
      <data key="d3">In an Indonesian setting, writing proper idiomatic expressions poses significant challenges for the majority of EFL students. Oftentimes, the idiomatic meanings deviate from the literal meanings and students are affected by their own first language and cultural contexts in usage. Therefore, this study explores the erroneous mistakes made by Indonesian EFL students and offers insights into teachers’ and students’ perspectives. This research will primarily examine the factors that influence university-level Academic Writing class students in incorrectly translating idiomatic expressions from the source language to the target language. The data for analysis was retrieved from students of Academic Writing classes from two different universities in West Java and Central Java to provide a comparative context in analyzing their mistakes. A comparative descriptive approach was applied, as this was deemed more appropriate for a study on semantic and translation strategies. The research results revealed that the study participants primarily experienced L1 interference, insufficient linguistic and grammatical knowledge, and a lack of lexical knowledge. Another obstacle was the students’ tendency to not heed cultural aspects in their writing and translating. Consequently, it is essential for EFL learners to be able to properly understand and translate idiomatic expressions in their writing to improve their target-language proficiency. Thus, instructors and students play crucial roles in successfully traversing this linguistic endeavor. Through proper instruction and active engagement, EFL learners can improve their linguistic mastery and cultural fluency, facilitating them to write more naturally in English.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">The group of Roma, who live and work in Greece, has failed to face the social prejudice regarding their social integration so far. The school dropout rate of Roma students, which in many cases confirms the inability of their school integration, also contributes to this. In addition, school integration is a prerequisite for the smooth social integration of students with social, cultural, economic, or learning difficulties. The purpose of this research is to investigate and identify the reasons that reinforce the phenomenon of school dropout of Roma students. Specifically, it investigates the views of 10 current Primary School Principals, which Roma students also attend, through semi-structured interviews. The conclusion drawn is that the cultural-socioeconomic background of the Roma is a deterrent to their normal schooling.  Article visualizations:</data>

It is suggested that music could be used in music education and in general education in relation to emotional education. This is not a new idea but should be critically rethought in relation to the aims of emotional education as well as reflecting on the main way in which it conceals the social roots and power relations in the experience and expression of emotions. The basis of this consideration is a brief review of the study of the history of emotions so that emphasis is given to the fact that emotions are also a social product. It is the hope that by at least moving into the field of music education and making some proposals, teachers and students will be able to gain more free space to experience and express emotions.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Unstoppable and constant advances in technology affect the inevitable changes in the ways and methods of teaching, but also changes in different students’ learning needs. New generations of students are characterized by mobility and because of that the information is very easily accessible, which requires the implementation of new trends in the educational process. One of these trends is mobile learning, which is available to young people everywhere and at any time 24/7. Therefore, it is scientifically and pedagogically justified to research the implementation and evaluation of such a new useful education tool in facilitating foreign language teaching. Mobile learning combines all forms of learning which refer to mobile devices and wireless internet. Such learning with the help of modern technologies would make it easier for students to acquire new knowledge, and at the same time to improve and to accelerate their personal and social development. Due to the various opportunities provided by mobile learning, the complexity of its implementation and implementation in teaching English as a foreign language increased almost exponentially. It has become particularly obvious in times of uncertainty such as the implementation of distance learning instead of traditional classroom teaching due to a sudden pandemic around the world. Although mobile learning is very often taken for granted because it is considered a disruptive factor in foreign language teaching (Aldrich, 2017), the affirmative attitude about mobile foreign language learning (MALL) (Zhang, Cristol, 2017) has become increasingly prevalent. The paper analyzes the results of a survey of English language teachers in primary and secondary schools in Osijek-Baranja County, which is one of the 21 counties in the Republic of Croatia, on attitudes toward mobile learning obtained from a sample of 121 participants. They point that the use of digital media in teaching is changing didactic and methodological methods and approaches to learning English, especially in secondary education. There is a lack of research on multimedia-didactic structuring of mobile learning in foreign language teaching in Croatia, this research will contribute to a better understanding of this issue but also offer possible solutions for designing innovative methods in teaching English from the aspect of mobile learning.  Article visualizations:</data>

When the infants build a simple seesaw machine ("robotic" seesaw) using the LEGO® Education Early Simple Machines Set, they start wondering about how it works. Acting collaboratively, the infants’ experiment with simple machines and make assumptions, each time experimenting according to the given instructions. Throughout the learning process, the teacher provides clear instructions and completes the findings of the infants, in order to draw the final conclusions that will lead to the solution of the problem. In this way, the infants are given the opportunity to develop computational thinking skills that can potentially open up new professional horizons in the future.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Needs analysis is critical in the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) development of teaching and learning because it decides learners' goals, needs, or deficiencies in the environmental situation. Learners are often taught and led in educational practices by textbooks authored by native speakers Ministry of Education and Training (MOET, 2008). However, Vietnam received a record of over 18 million of international arrivals in 2019 arrivals (VNAT, 2022). An analysis must evaluate real-life conditions to find difficulties met when working as a hotel receptionist. This research looks at the lives of eighteen hotel receptionists in Can Tho, Vietnam. A quantitative approach is used in this research to find out in what ways hotel receptionists use their positions and the obstacles they experience on the job. The study results show that hotel receptionists employ four skills, but speaking and listening are significantly more critical in this sector. Furthermore, hotel receptionists need help with these abilities when speaking with non-native visitors. The findings imply that, besides textbook resources, educators and curriculum designers could include distinct accents from non-native English speakers into a curriculum for ESP learners. Practical markets, particularly in Asia, now have implications for real-world tourism development practices.  Article visualizations:</data>

A form consisting of 4 open-ended questions was used. The qualitative data obtained from the answers to these questions were evaluated through content analysis. At the end of the application, it shows that teachers and teacher candidates know the ways to recognize culture and intercultural situations and that the teacher candidates who are not aware of these situations are more than the teachers. Both teachers and teacher candidates see cultural diversity as a privilege that is positive, useful and can develop people both socially and individually. When asked about the contributions of cultural diversity to mathematics education, they agreed that both teachers and teacher candidates will develop students socially, increase course efficiency and provide permanent and meaningful learning, and develop the mind individually and create a rich perspective. However, teachers had more negative ideas about the reflection of cultural diversity in their classrooms on mathematics education than teacher candidates and stated that students would have problems with adaptation, disagreements, and communication problems would increase.  Article visualizations:</data>

The quality of the work depends on the provision of On the Job Training (OJT) programme which is overseen by MoMP. As a result, there is a need for further investigation to determine the OJT quality factors that are associated with Trainer Quality, Effective Assessment, Clear Expectation, Learning Stimulation, Competence Development, Training Relevance, Training Resources, Effective support and Active Learning on students’ satisfaction. The study has embraced the quantitative and positivists method of research, using a stratified random sample to gauge 8 TVET institutes with a total sample of 317 participants. Additionally, the reliability of the test depends on Alpha Cronbach’s scale, and it scored acceptable levels i.e., 0.772 to 0.809. The survey instrument of Coates (2009) was adopted and the literature review was done to support the research conceptual frame. The support theories were based on SERVQUAL, TQM and Kirkpatrick four level of training evaluation model. The study survey used five Likert scales to analyze the data. The evaluation of OJT quality factors on TVET students’ satisfaction was measured, P value &lt;0.01 and found statistically significant. The sample adequacy was measured by using KMO and Bartlett’s test and scored 0.833 within the threshold. Also, the research used three measurements of Goodness of fit and met the required threshold. Nonetheless, the hypothesis results showed an overall of 70% of hypotheses have a significant effect on TVET students’ satisfaction. Finally, the research contributes to developing work skills to meet students’ satisfaction.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Ernest Hemingway, a distinguished writer, is well-known for his writing theory called the “Iceberg Principle.” This theory is used to introduce the concept of Heroism, which depicts the images of heroes differently from the traditional stereotype. His novels and collections of short stories were written permeating the Iceberg Principle. Among them, In Another Country, Old Man at the Bridge, and The Old Man and the Sea characterized the heroes with their unique characteristics which readers needed to dig out to get a deeper insight into man’s fate with emotional overtones. The current study, with a qualitative and descriptive approach, illuminates Heroism in these short stories. The results show that there are five aspects that Hemingway applied to reflect his Heroism including age, life tragedies, isolation, persistence, and stoicism. Besides, throughout the three stories, one can see the development of Hemingway's heroes as they strive to reach perfection during his literary career.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Bandura’s reaction to the depictions of human agency that were propagated by the trait, behaviorist, and psychodynamic theories yielded the social cognitive theory. Through the social cognitive theory emerged the concept of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is one’s judgment of the capabilities to bring about desired outcomes. An understanding of the concept of self-efficacy and its sources has implications for the training of pre-service science teachers to effectively teach science. This article aims to use theoretical and empirical studies concerning Bandura’s theoretical sources of self-efficacy - Enactive Mastery Experience, Vicarious Experiences, Verbal Persuasion, and Physiological and Psychological State – to guide science teacher educators in determining effective approaches to developing a sense of self-efficacy in their pre-service science teachers. The article summarizes each of the sources of self-efficacy. It simultaneously provides suggestions to science teacher educators for inculcating a high sense of self-efficacy in their pre-service science teachers.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d2">Filippos Evangelou</data>
      <data key="d3">This paper attempts to study basic teaching techniques that contribute to the development of the learner-centred approach in the classroom of modern schools. More specifically, the purpose of this paper is to develop seven teaching techniques - brainstorming, concept maps, working groups, role-playing, problem-solving, debate, De Bono's Six Thinking Hats - that contribute effectively to teaching and learning through the development of a learner-centred approach. The choice of this topic arose from the fact that the above teaching techniques are interesting and original educational tools since they place the learner at the centre of the educational process and in this way the intended learning outcomes are achieved after the end of the teaching. This paper is based on the literature review of about 180 researches and studies both in Greek and International level through the search of databases and search engines such as ERIC, Google Scholar, etc. Finally, it is worth noting that this paper aims to provide a useful guide for teachers to utilize these teaching techniques in the classroom since when these innovative teaching techniques are applied in the context of the learner-centred approach they have significant advantages such as focusing on students' needs, making the lesson more engaging, enhancing students' self-confidence and collaborative skills, etc.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">The school community consists of an environment where every child has the right to participate and share the good of the educational process. In that thinking, students dispose of different needs that have to be satisfied in a context where the values of respect and equality emerge as basic foundations of the instructive environment. Consequently, inclusion practices appear to be as the prerequisite of education for all in the general school surroundings. Teachers who are responsible for planning and applying the educational process play an important role in the implementation of inclusive practices. Especially, these educational methods are influenced by educators’ attitudes and determine the extent and the level of inclusion strategies. In the present study, participated 154 teachers of primary and secondary general education in Greece. The participants completed the Multidimensional Attitudes towards Inclusive Education Scale (MATIES) (Mahat, 2008). In general, according to the results, teachers expressed positive attitudes toward inclusion. Correlations were calculated in relation to other variables that affect teachers’ attitudes according to the research. The results emerged as directions of providing support services in the school community and organizing suitable education programs for in-service teachers in the school and academic domain.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Promotion and upgrading of teachers after years of service and/or further studies are very essential in the working life of teachers as other formal employees. This is because promotion and upgrading serve as motivational means for hard work and high productivity. However, they do not come without challenges. The challenges inherent in the processes of promotion and upgrading of teachers and the effects the challenges have on teachers seemed to have received little scientific investigation. This research gap precipitated the conduct of this exercise in the Bono region of Ghana. The descriptive survey study was conducted among public senior high school teachers and a sample size of 246 was used. The data were collected using a survey questionnaire and SPSS version 23 was used to analyze the data. The study revealed the following as the challenges teachers encounter during promotions: irregular and untimely release of promotion information, long procedure in the application, too many documents required, and untimely release of promotion results. The challenges tend to have effects on teachers’ work output as well as their psychological, social, and emotional well-being. The study further disclosed that the teachers encounter challenges with upgrading as well which also tends to affect them psychologically, emotionally, and socially as well as their work output. It is therefore concluded that the challenges that the teachers encounter while undergoing promotion and upgrading tend to have an effect on their psychological, social and emotional states as well as their confidence to work which can affect their work output. This would be detrimental to student learning and progress. The study then recommends that the Ghana Education Service (GES) has to take the necessary steps to eliminate the challenges inherent in promotion and upgrading to enable teachers to devote adequate time to their work.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">The (coronavirus disease of 2019) COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented changes in education, leading to the exploration of unconventional learning tools. This study investigates the use of the popular social media platform Instagram as a means of facilitating self-directed learning. A survey was conducted among university students with 500 respondents participating anonymously. 63% of the respondents were female, and 85.2 %, were aged under 30. Only 7.6% of participants reported negative mental health issues relating to Instagram use, while the majority revealed positive attitudes, competitiveness, and strong focus on their educational goals. Instagram served as a platform for students to form small or large social circles in which they supported one another by addressing their educational needs, assisting each other with challenging assignments, and engaging in small group study sessions and quizzes. Notably, most respondents (65.4%) indicated that they use educational Instagram pages as a source of knowledge and learning, while a significant portion (34.6%) mentioned that while they access the platform with the intention of learning, they also encounter unnecessary or irrelevant posts, resulting in time wastage. In conclusion, this paper suggests that while Instagram may not be the ideal tool for deployment within a teacher's arsenal, it can serve as an effective source of peer mentoring and support in the post-COVID educational world.  Article visualizations:</data>

The patriarchal agents in these novels enforce white beauty standards, dictate women's roles and behaviors, emphasize marriage and motherhood, and use sexual exploitation to control women. Research has shown that both novels have received widespread critical attention, exploring themes including the politics of maternal violence, counter-memory, biopower, internal racism, and colonialism. However, a comparative study of &lt;em&gt;Sula&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Paradise&lt;/em&gt; through Foucault's concepts of disciplinary power and constant surveillance may reveal the subtle ways power operates in patriarchal societies, and by analyzing the female characters' resistance strategies, the study may uncover how women challenge and resist patriarchal norms.

      <data key="d3">Blended learning as a new paradigm in modern education offers an alternative model of learning where technology is incorporated into the educators’ courses along with classroom face-to-face activities. This learning trend has gained momentum, in Morocco, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. BL does not only aim to cope with the global quantum leap in the field of education, but also to insure the learners’ effective involvement in the learning process. This paper aims to assess the learners’ willingness to switch to BL, to identify its most appropriate models for the learners, to value their efficiency in preparing future university graduates, and to inspect the constraints that hinder the prevalence of this type of teaching on a larger scale. This study uses a quantitative method to analyse data. Hence, we resorted to a survey of 200 university students from different tertiary institutions in the region of Fez-Meknes, most of whom testified to the efficiency of BL and expressed their joy to adopt this new trend. Because of logistical deficiency, a few learners expressed their worries. Consequently, our recommendations relate to allocating significant financial help to assist students in difficulty and provide them with technical assistance, in order to engage them in BL and attain equity among learners.  Article visualizations:</data>

We performed Pearson Correlation analysis to determine the relationship between motor skills and social skills. The result of the research showed that the motor skills of preschool children showed a significant difference according to the gender of the children (p&lt;0.05). Preschool children were exposed to a significant difference according to children's ages in terms of locomotor skills and total motor skills (p&lt;0.01). The social skills of these children revealed a statistically significant difference in line with their gender (p&lt;0.01). On the other hand, there was no statistically significant difference according to the age of the children (p&gt;0.05). The body mass index of preschool children's ground motor and social skills did not show a statistically significant difference according to their Body Mass Index (BMI) levels (p&gt;0.05). Our study could not identify a meaningful relationship between motor skills and the children's social skills (p&gt;0.05).  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d2">Asli Koculu; Mustafa Sami Topcu</data>
      <data key="d3">In recent years, integration of engineering design with science teaching has often been preferred more since STEM Education (based on the integration of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines) has been an integral part of science education in many countries all over the world. Integrating engineering design with science teaching can be complex for science teachers because it has been relatively new and teachers have not been trained enough about it yet. Within this context, it is crucial to raise pre-service science teachers (PSTs) capable of integrating the engineering design process with science teaching effectively because they are implementers of future science teaching. In this manner, the purpose of this study is to explore pre-service science teachers’ (PSTs) engineering design performance development through STEM Education. A case study design was used in the current research. The research group was 20 PSTs who enrolled in ‘STEM Education’ course at a public university in Istanbul, Turkey. The data were collected with open-ended forms including 9 steps of the engineering design process. In the data analysis process, open-ended forms including PSTs’ responses about what they did in every step of engineering design for each STEM practices were analyzed with ‘Engineer’s Notebook Rubric’. Results showed that PSTs’ engineering design performance improved considerably week by week during ‘STEM Education’ course.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Trust is the most basic need after nutrition in human life. The most basic need in business life, which is a part of human life, is trust. Employees should feel safe in their work life. Teachers who develop a sense of confidence can raise successful students. For this reason, it is important to determine teachers' organizational trust perceptions. In this study, first of all, teachers' organizational trust levels were examined. Then, the differentiation of teachers' organizational trust levels according to gender, graduation status, seniority and school-level variables was examined. The research was designed in the scanning model. The “Organizational Trust Scale” developed by Yılmaz (2006) was used to determine teachers' perceptions of organizational trust. The data were analyzed with descriptive analysis, t_test and ANOVA analysis. According to the findings, teachers trust their schools at a high level. Accordingly, teachers' gender, educational status and seniority do not affect their organizational trust perceptions. The school-level variable affects teachers' perceptions of organizational trust. This result shows that teachers working in primary schools have higher organizational trust perceptions. As a result, policies should be developed to improve the organizational trust perceptions of teachers working in secondary and high schools.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Teacher leadership has become an important aspect of the modern education system. Teacher leadership involves teachers assuming leadership roles and responsibilities, with the aim to drive improvement and positively impact student’s learning outcomes. Effective teacher leaders possess a combination of instructional expertise, collaboration skills, vision and initiative, communication ability, adaptability, advocacy, and ethical and professional dispositions. This qualitative study aims at examining teachers’ trainees’ perspective on teacher leadership. The study employed online semi-structured interviews of 37 teacher trainees from three teacher colleges in Morocco. The findings indicated that though most participants could not define teacher leadership in a broader manner, they are still super-conscious that teacher attitude is the most influential factor in teacher leadership practice. Regardless of those lopsided findings, there is a need for further investment in this field as teacher leadership is becoming increasingly important for teachers to contribute to driving change and making a positive impact on the education system as a whole.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Many students in Saudi Arabia complain that they achieve poor results in mathematics and appear to have a negative attitude toward the subject. The current study, therefore, investigates students’ attitudes towards mathematics, using a mixed method approach, in 13-16 years old students from the intermediate level of education. The age was important because this period is thought to be crucial to the formation of lasting attitudes and opinions. The first main research question, the study aims to address is therefore, “What are students’ attitudes towards mathematics in Saudi middle schools?” The study also aims to explore gender issues using a second research question, “Is there any significant gender difference in students’ attitudes towards mathematics?” The survey was conducted in two government-run middle schools in Saudi Arabia, one boys’ school and one girls’ school, because Saudi Arabia has an exclusively single-sex education system. 180 participants (90 boys and 90 girls) were asked to complete a questionnaire to show their views about mathematics. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected at the same time, but the analysis of each type of information was conducted separately to enable the full picture to be understood. T-test was used to explore any gender differences. The main findings were that both male and female students in two Saudi middle schools show a positive attitude towards mathematics, with female students being slightly more positive than males. The factors which affect attitudes towards mathematics in both genders include the usefulness of mathematics in everyday and future life and career, the teacher, enjoyment of mathematics and the difficulty of the subjects. Girls’ attitudes towards mathematics were also affected by the influence of social media personalities and internet teachers.   Article visualizations:</data>

To combine the data from diverse sources, the research employed a literature review strategy. Dropout risk was defined as the possibility of students leaving school before finishing their secondary education, while student engagement was described as the degree of participation, interest, and excitement that students display in their learning process. Motivation, expectations, mental health, substance abuse, parental involvement, grade retention, IQ, learning difficulties, academic achievement, curriculum quality, relevance, consistency, alignment, teacher capacity, teaching materials, assessment system, governance, and management were identified as factors influencing student engagement and dropout risk at the individual, classroom, school, and system levels. The study found that the curriculum and assessment policies and practices in Mogadishu-Somalia were low in quality, inconsistent, irrelevant, and misaligned with the national standards and the needs of the learners and society. The study recommended improving and aligning the curriculum and assessment policies and practices in secondary education in Mogadishu-Somalia with the national standards, the needs of the learners and society, and the principles of student engagement and differentiation. To achieve this goal, the study suggested developing and sharing a clear vision and goals, involving all stakeholders in the curriculum and assessment processes, adapting the curriculum and assessment to the diverse needs of students, engaging and motivating students in the curriculum and assessment, and improving teacher capacity, curriculum framework, teaching and learning materials, assessment and certification system, and governance and management of the education sector.  Article visualizations:</data>

This paper focuses on leaders̉ actions to encourage the organization and implementation of innovations in the school organization. In the present work, an attempt is made to investigate in a sample of 104 directors of Primary Education in the Region of Western Greece issues related to the necessity and climate of introducing innovative actions in the school organization they serve, the suitability of specific models - leadership style for implementing innovations in school organization and encouraging and supporting actions to implement innovations in schools. The research highlighted the need for education through the implementation of innovative actions with an important factor being the existence of a positive communication climate through a democratic leadership style. Innovation incentives seem to be related to having a relevant master's degree, training and years of management, while in-school training as an innovation support action seems to be related to the years of management. In fact, the success of an innovative action is never guaranteed, but it depends on many factors, making the role of the principal in the school organization crucial.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">A solid curriculum is one of the most important components of education. Knowledge is advancing and society is changing as a result of science and technological growth. the purpose of this study was to review the curriculum change and innovation for higher education in Somalia. Curriculum change is both deliberate and unplanned changes in concepts, including invention, development, and adoption. Innovation is a planned part of the curriculum change. The study was guided by complexity theory since social systems sometimes require curriculum changes. most of Somalia’s higher education institutions lack formal curriculum plans due to the absence of a federal agency that could help regulate higher education or develop standards that could be shared. In Somalia, higher education is facing challenges, including a lack of effective curricula guidelines, quality standards, and other significant sources of support in the education sector. The study recommended among others the establishment of a National Commission for higher education with clear policy and independency to overview the curriculum in higher education institutions.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Teaching quality refers to the level of teaching practices, delivery, content and methods and it is often viewed subjectively by various stakeholders in education, including students. The aim of this study, applying a phenomenographic approach, was to replicate a study conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic with master students in Finland. Applying a similar process and participants, the study aimed to explore whether students’ perceptions of teaching quality had altered after the Covid-19 increase in online teaching and learning. Three main themes arose from the interview data: teaching quality as clarity, teaching quality as engagement, and teaching quality as either online teaching or contact teaching. These themes differ from the pre-Covid themes in which teaching quality was associated with pedagogical professionalism, personal qualities of the teacher and the general learning environment. It can be inferred that the increased online modes and environments in higher education in Finland have had an impact on students and what they perceive as teaching quality. Teaching is also increasingly viewed through the personal experiences of the students, both positive and negative, and an emotional reaction to teaching and learning was also evident in the post-Covid data.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">It is quite important for the individual to actively participate in the educational process during language teaching. It is possible to involve the students in the learning process thanks to the use of various student-centered activities and appeal to more than one sense organ. The methods, techniques, and materials to be used in the language acquisition process of the students also affect their attitudes and self-efficacy towards the language learning process and the related skills. As an important part of the children’s literature, tales have an important function in language teaching. In this study, the impact of multisensory learning model-oriented storytelling on listening self-efficacy levels was examined. Experimental design, one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the study. The study group of the research consists of 5th grade students studying at a secondary school in the city center of Samsun during the academic year of 2021 and 2022. The age group of the students involved in the research ranges from 10 to 11. In addition, both individual and parental consents were obtained for the application. The Listening Self-Efficacy Scale was used as the data collection tool of the research. In order to collect the research data, permissions were obtained first from the Samsun Provincial Directorate of National Education and then the parents of the students. Lasting for 5 weeks, storytelling activities were applied to the experimental and control groups. For the control group, taletelling application was carried out through straight narrative technique while for the experimental group, it was carried out through multisensory learning model. Quantitative data analysis methods were used to analyze the research data. As a result of the research, it was seen that the listening skills of the experimental group changed positively. In addition, in the comparisons performed depending on the variables, it was concluded that the listening skills of the students whose father's education level was primary school, whose age level was 11, and whose grades for Turkish lesson were low in the previous year improved at a higher level.

      <data key="d3">Nowadays, scholars and researchers adhere to the prominent role information and communication technologies (ICT) play in education, particularly in language teaching. The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has developed a set of standards that provide a framework for developing digital competencies among educators, students, administrators, coaches, and computer science teachers. In light of ISTE standards for educators, the present paper probes the roles teachers play with special reference to the designer and facilitator standards. The target population are EFL Moroccan high school teachers who work in the private sector in the Directorate of Marrakesh, Morocco. Through a quantitative analysis, findings indicate that the teachers in question generally fulfill their roles as ICT designers and facilitators. They adopt technology as a buttressing tool to install a learning-favorite environment. Plainly enough, they use technology-enhanced activities that promote student-centered learning. To a lesser degree, they facilitate collaborative learning and encourage the students to act globally by getting them engaged with the real world through technology. Likewise, this study discloses the existence of a symmetrical relationship between the mastery of internet/computer skills and the use-effectiveness of ICT tools, such as the interactive board and the data shown. In this respect, this study accentuates how adequate training and professional development-bound upskilling can truly promote the target EFL teachers’ digital competencies and help them live up to their roles as ICT designers and facilitators.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Educators always endeavor to unravel the myriad of unexplained variables in learning environments. Examination taking is one such variable. Given the importance attached to examination results, educators seek answers as to why some students have shorter completion time than others and whether they end up scoring better than those who finish later. Is this phenomenon related to their levels of academic self-efficacy? This study set out to investigate the relationship between academic behavior confidence, test scores and test completion time. It was grounded on the self-efficacy theory by Albert Bandura. In an exam-taking situation, twenty-five early finishers and twenty-five late finishers were identified in a common unit examination in a public university in Kenya. They later filled out the Academic Behavior Confidence scale developed by Sander &amp; Sanders (2019). The relationships between the completion time, the test scores on the common unit and their Academic Behavior Confidence scores were investigated using non-parametric approaches, specifically the Spearman’s rho and Mann-Whitney U test. Results show a significant difference between completion time and test scores. Paradoxically, there is no significant difference between completion time and ABC scores. However, there is a positive relationship between test scores and Academic Behavior Confidence scores. It is recommended that educators should use mastery experiences, verbal persuasion and vicarious experiences to enhance Academic Self-efficacy, which may, in turn, improve test scores..  Article visualizations:</data>

As part of Bruner's theoretical framework, individuals produce new ideas or concepts based on prior information. Their expertise is needed to choose and process data. This study applies this approach because the cognitive structure organizes perceptions and helps individuals go beyond knowledge because evaluating self-learning material quality teaches teachers new concepts (SLMs). The finding reveals that participants feel honored and pressured, some are ready to carry out any assignment, and some are happy and excited. Participants indicated the advantage indicated learning new things and meaningful experiences, while the disadvantage indicated adding workloads. This research may support and motivate teacher-evaluators to tailor instruction to meet individual needs. Whether they differentiate content, process, products, or the learning environment, ongoing assessment and flexible grouping make this a successful approach to assessing students' SLMs quality. This study would provide a framework to build certain tasks, activities, or modules to motivate teachers and help them focus attention, organize information for understanding and remembering, monitor and assess learning, encourage self-monitoring, and self-correct tools for reflecting on and assessing their own learning in evaluating the quality assurance of SLM's.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d2">John Mensah</data>
      <data key="d3">This paper aims to explore the effect of using GeoGebra in teaching and learning circle theorems on student-teachers’ performance. This paper is based on the results of the four-week experiment of GeoGebra software in teaching and learning the concepts of circle theorems of the geometry of student-teachers at the College of Education. The effectiveness of using GeoGebra software was explored by measuring the achievement level with the help of achievement tests and perceptions of using GeoGebra software through the questionnaire. The data were analyzed and interpreted by using a frequency distribution table, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and t-test. The findings showed that there was a higher mean score in achievement in circle theorems of the experimental group, that is, those taught with GeoGebra software than that of the control group, that is, those taught without GeoGebra software, and the difference was significant at 0.05 level. Similarly, the student-teachers of the experimental group had a positive perception to support the use of GeoGebra software in teaching and learning circle theorems in geometry and mathematics in general. Thus, the use of GeoGebra software is an effective tool to increase achievement; promote curiosity and creativity; make clear sense of concepts and encourage overall learning of students in mathematics. Finally, this study suggests that mathematics teachers need to use ICT tools including GeoGebra for effective teaching and learning.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d1">2023</data>
      <data key="d2">Clemence Mbiza; Flora O. Kasumba; Brown Gwambene</data>
      <data key="d3">The study assessed public primary school teachers' strategies for accommodating learners with vernacular language backgrounds in Hanang District, Tanzania. The study involved 110 participants, including 44 teachers and 49 pupils, 4 Ward Education Officers, 1 School Quality Assurance Officer, 1 District Primary Academic Officer, and 11 head teachers. The study employed a mixed research approach. The study selected the sample size using simple random and purposive sampling, and we collected the data through questionnaires, interviews, and observation. The collected data was analyzed using computer software, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 20). The study's findings indicated that most public primary school teachers in Hanang used multiple teaching strategies, such as songs, total physical response, questions and answers, the direct method, and reading aloud, to accommodate pupils with vernacular language backgrounds. These strategies were most frequently employed in lower levels, exceptionally standard one and two. Further, primary school teachers were using teaching and learning materials like pictures, photographs, drawings, cards, flip charts, and natural objects. Also, primary school teachers assess and evaluate their pupils through written exercises, tests, questions and answers, and oral quizzes. The study concluded that multiple teaching strategies helped learners with vernacular backgrounds in public primary schools to master Kiswahili. Also, the assessment and evaluation tools in public primary schools effectively accommodated all pupils’ capabilities and levels of skills. Therefore, teachers should construct standard tests. Hence, the study recommended that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) organize seminars, workshops and in-service training (IN-SET) to update and impart new knowledge to the teachers on using teaching strategies and preparing practical assessment tools. The government should also employ enough primary school teachers specialized in early childhood education, construct many classrooms and supply sufficient and relevant teaching and learning materials.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d2">Li-Wei Wei</data>
      <data key="d3">In the current socio-digital epoch, the intricate interplay between social media addiction and its potential ramifications on romantic relationships remains largely enigmatic, especially within specific demographic subsets. This study aims to elucidate the repercussions of social media addiction on love relationship closeness and satisfaction among Chinese undergraduates. A cohort of 583 Chinese undergraduates was meticulously analyzed, encompassing an almost equal gender distribution and spanning across diverse academic ranks and relationship durations. Utilizing the "Social Media Addiction Scale - Adult Form (SMAS-AF)" and validated scales for assessing relationship intimacy and satisfaction, the research painted a multifaceted picture. Findings revealed a high inclination towards social media addiction (X=4.20), with specific aspects of engagement demonstrating profound agreement among participants. An analytic exploration of the addiction demonstrated a pronounced influence on cognitive faculties and emotional regulation while revealing less consistent challenges in curtailing usage. In the romantic realm, while relationship closeness yielded a moderate mean score of 3.38, love relationship satisfaction signaled a moderate-to-high satisfaction degree (X=3.83). Interestingly, while gender and academic progression remained non-determinants for addiction levels, relationship length emerged as a significant variable. Correlational analyses showcased a stark negative association between social media addiction and relationship closeness (r= -.491) but, surprisingly, a positive correlation with relationship satisfaction (r= .129). Such dichotomous outcomes advocate for deeper investigation, perhaps suggesting a paradigm wherein intensified digital engagement might enhance superficial relationship contentment at the potential cost of depth and closeness.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">The language used in healthcare to describe diseases, medical procedures, and treatments is identified as medical terminology. Learning medical terminology can be problematic owing to its complexity and volume. Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an artificial intelligence (AI) language model that can simulate human conversations while providing individualized feedback, making it potentially a viable tool for learning medical terminology. The purpose of this study is to look at the benefits of using ChatGPT to learn medical terminology. A ChatGPT-based group studied medical terminology using the ChatGPT platform, while a traditional study group heard lectures and read textbooks. Following the study sessions, both groups carried out a test to evaluate their understanding and comprehension of medical terms. The study showed that the ChatGPT-based platform was more effective than traditional teaching techniques in increasing students' knowledge and understanding of medical terminology. When compared to the traditional instruction group, the group using the ChatGPT platform demonstrated significant improvements in their test results. ChatGPT offers the opportunity to improve medical terminology learning by providing students with interactive and individualized feedback. The outcomes of this study can assist with the development of novel and successful teaching techniques incorporating artificial intelligence into education.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d2">Alexandra Nousia</data>
      <data key="d3">Infant massage is a scientifically proven practice that promotes the physical and mental health of the infant. The term infant massage refers to the application of touch to the infant by the parent or caregiver during the first year of life with specific massages. Through the following literature review, the benefits of infant massage for the infant, the family and the wider society are noted and commented on. The benefits of its application to the infant are recorded in four different areas. These refer to the concept of the infant's interaction with the parent/caregiver, stimulation, relief and relaxation respectively, of the premature and full-term infant. As far as parents are concerned, infant massage seems to enhance their own parenting practices, as well as their self-confidence and sense of security, while reducing symptoms of postnatal depression. In addition, through healthy touch and massage, benefits are documented in reliable adaptive changes in the community. These include a reduction in abuse, violence, and crime, as well as a reduction in the expenditure of government health care funds. Research evidence supports that the implementation of infant massage can show a reduction in the cost of spending in Infant Health Units of premature and non-premature infants. Healthy touch and physical contact through massage during infant massage by trained mothers or trained staff when the mother is unavailable can significantly enhance the faster development and psychosomatic health of infants.  Article visualizations:</data>

If teachers do not keep up with global developments, particularly those brought about by technology, they will be out of place in this era. Three research questions were formed to guide the conduct of this study, purposive sampling techniques were used to select five participants, and themes that emerged were perception (life-long process, teachers’ needs and a way of getting new ideas), the second research question reveals the different types of professional development that the teachers attended while the last theme reveals the challenges the teacher encountered such as lack of funding, availability of the program, time constraint, transportation issue and incompetent personnel. The study concluded that the issue of professional development cannot be over-emphasized, and the following recommendation was made; teacher professional development should be made available to all teachers and not just some few privileged ones; there should be proper monitoring during the selection process so that those that are non-teachers are not selected; government should also ensure that teachers are motivated (financially) when they are going for continuing education.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">This mixed-method analysis investigates thesis-writing burnout among 117 Chinese postgraduates, probing the patterns, magnitude, and influencing factors. A measurable burnout trend emerges across thesis-writing stages - Thesis-Writing Proposal (TTP), Thesis-Writing 3-Chapter (TW3C), and Thesis-Writing 5-Chapter (TW5C) - peaking (X=4.41) during TW3C, reflecting heightened exhaustion and cynicism. Notably, burnout varies with demographic attributes, specifically gender and marital status. Concurrently, exhaustion and cynicism levels fluctuate with thesis-writing progression, while professional efficacy gradually escalates. Participants convey a shift from profound exhaustion and cynicism in TTP and TW3C stages to resilience, manageable fatigue, and self-assuredness during TW5C. Predisposing factors encompass uncertainty, anxiety, and advisory attributes, spanning styles, diligence, and personality traits. These aspects, especially autocratic and laissez-faire approaches, exacerbate stress and impact motivation and research methods. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of academic burnout during thesis-writing among Chinese postgraduates, necessitating stage-specific interventions. Such tailored strategies facilitate burnout prevention, promote thesis completion, and yield profound implications for Chinese conventional postgraduate education. The research also establishes the vital role of advisors in modulating stress levels, underscoring the need for proactive support measures and fostering a conducive academic environment. This study augments understanding of academic burnout, offering valuable insights to counteract its detrimental effects and bolster postgraduate students' academic journey.  Article visualizations:</data>

The traditional conceptions of preschool teachers and the state from the provision of exclusive care to the education and training of infants are revealed. Using music education as a main tool, the opinions of preschool teachers today on the contribution of music to the development and education of early childhood children are explored. A Mixed Method Research (M.M.R.) was preferred to conduct the study, combining quantitative and qualitative data. Regarding the contribution of music to child all-round development, preschool teachers claimed that music enhances children's motor development by 76.3%, emotional by 73.5%, and aesthetic development by 71.2%. This was followed by the development of children's creativity through music education by 65.1%, language development by 59.6%, then social development by 56.2% and finally children's cognitive development by 48.9%.  Article visualizations:</data>

Based on Permendikbud No 161 of 2014 concerning Technical Guidelines for the Management of Regular School Operational Assistance Funds. BOS fund management has at least three indicators: Planning, implementation and reporting. These three indicators are the benchmark for managing BOS funds well. The research method uses a literature study with a meta-analysis of ten national journal review results based on BOS fund management indicators: Planning, implementation, and reporting. Results of this study: 1. Planning involves all school residents, including the principal, treasurer, teachers, employees, committees, and parents. This Planning is poured in the form of the preparation of RKAS. RKAS is made with various considerations and by the conditions of each elementary school. 2. The implementation of BOS fund management, starting with the withdrawal of funds; some are carried out in Dahab, and some are all at once; the collection adjusts to each condition and then allocates by the RKAS that has been made. The collection of BOS funds must be recorded in detail and clearly. As well as leaving a minimum balance as a precaution. 3. Reporting is carried out gradually and every day so that it is monitored in real and particular. This reporting is in the form of a unique BOS fund governance book.  Article visualizations:</data>

However, there are no standard answers as to how exams are best suited to ensure this. There is considerable variation in students’ preferences for different exam types. In this study, the focus is on students’ attitudes towards the choice of exam type. This survey features management students from Norway, who study for a master's degree in order to pursue a career in the public sector. The results show that students are well motivated to learn, but they are sensitive to the choice of exam type. This affects effort, motivation, and expected success. There are different views on the types of exams that are perceived to be fair. The oral exam stands out in particular, as female students have great anxiety in relation to this form of exam.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Decades of research support the benefits of movement for cognitive development however this link remains unexploited in educational practice. For this reason, embodied cognition serves as the theoretical underpinnings of this study proposing that thoughts and actions are influenced by sensory experience. Fifty-eight 6th-grade students were divided into two groups: The first group participated in activities designed for full-body movement and the second observed the haptic manipulation of materials by an educator. The study thus utilized a two-group design and was conducted in phases: pretest, intervention, immediate posttest and delayed posttest. The entire process was recorded to assess students’ understanding and the multimodal text thereby created included both spoken word and bodily expressions such as posture and gestures, enabling us to closely follow the progress of every participant. The range of responses was then narrowed down to adequate and inadequate, followed by statistical processing of the data. The results showed that both execution and observation effectively contributed to the improved performance of students immediately after the interventions. Nevertheless, students who participated in bodily-based activities showed an additional advantage four months later. While this study focused solely on circular motion, the idea to investigate physical engagement and its impact on students’ understanding could be extended to other content, and the long-term effectiveness of bodily-based learning ought to encourage a redesign of the official curriculum.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">Public service ethics is a scientific category belonging to philosophy, related to the public service activities of a state. Each state has its own regulations on public service ethics and has a different institution of public service ethics. In Vietnam, the institution of civil service ethics is increasingly progressive and complete with relatively complete and clear regulations. However, these regulations are still expressed sporadically and inconsistently in many legal documents such as the Law on cadres and civil servants; Law on public employees; Law on anti-corruption, etc. In fact, the legal regulations on public service ethics and the actual situation of strictly handling violations of public service ethics for the past time have created a great deterrent to public service enforcers; and at the same time contribute to curbing and preventing corrupt acts. This article introduces the elements constituting the institution of public service ethics; the actual situation of organizing the implementation of the institution of civil service ethics in Vietnam and proposes solutions..  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">The aim of this study is to determine which types of questions are most frequently included in the book titled Silver Lining, which is taught in English classes in 11th grades in Turkey, and at what level of understanding questions are asked. For this purpose, the analysis of the reading questions in the "Reading and Listening" section of the English textbook was carried out. Barrett's Taxonomy was used as a basis to determine the mental processes required by the questions. Since the questions in the book were examined in the study, the qualitative research method, one of the research methods, was adopted and document analysis was conducted. Within the scope of the research, ten units in the book titled Silver Lining were examined. There are two sections in each unit, section A and section B. There are six or seven question guidelines under the title "Reading and Writing" in each section. Within the scope of this study, a total of 263 reading comprehension questions, including 149 question instructions and 114 question items in the entire book, were examined. The eleventh grade English textbook mostly includes matching questions and multiple-choice questions. Open-ended questions, which have a very small share among the question types, were asked in a way that the answers could be easily found in the text. Additionally, it was observed that the questions were asked mostly at the level of simple understanding. In this sense, the text questions in the eleventh grade English textbook should be diversified by teachers, and in addition to simple questions, students should be asked more questions that will activate metacognition, thus enabling them to think critically.  Article visualizations:</data>

      <data key="d3">13520 Background: Gefitinib (IRESSA) is an oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown supra-additive activity in human CRC xenografts when combined with irinotecan. We have previously established that the recommended dose level (RDL) to be irinotecan 225mg/m2 q3 weeks and gefitinib 250mg daily (Chau et al ASCO 2004). The dose limiting toxicities were neutropenia and diarrhoea. The continuation phase of this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Between Jun 2002 and Feb 2005, patients (pts) with advanced CRC progressing on or within 12 weeks of fluoropyrimidines-based chemotherapy, irinotecan-naïve and performance status ≤2 were recruited. Thirty-nine pts were treated with irinotecan and gefitinib in total with 27 treated at the RDL.


RESULTS
Median age was 61 years (range: 31-79) and 13 (33.3%) pts were females. All pts were Caucasians (94.9%) and non-oriental Asians (5.1%). Thirteen (33.3%) pts had received (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and 16 (41.0%) pts had prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Grades 3-4 toxicities were anaemia 2.6%, neutropenia 15.4%, febrile neutropenia 10.3%, diarrhoea 35.9%, nausea 2.6%, vomiting 5.1%, lethargy 15.4% and skin rash 7.7%. For the pts treated at RDL, the objective tumour response rate was 11.1% (3 partial responses [PRs]; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-29.2%) and the disease control rate was 40.7% (3PRs, 8 stable diseases lasting for ≥12 weeks). The median time to progression was 4.2 months and median survival was 9.3 months. Six-month progression free survival was 22.2% (95% CI: 6.5-37.9%) and 6-month overall survival was 73.4% (95% CI: 56.5-90.3%). Preliminary pharmacokinetic data suggested that the addition of irinotecan to gefitinib resulted in an average of 14-33% increase in exposure to gefitinib (p&lt;0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Irinotecan and gefitinib at this dose schedule was tolerable. Gefitinib did not appear to add substantial efficacy to irinotecan. The relative low dose of irinotecan at the RDL and the rarity of EGFR somatic mutation in CRC may be contributory to the modest activity of irinotecan and gefitinib combination.

      <data key="d0">New surgical treatments for faecal incontinence</data>
      <data key="d1">2016</data>
      <data key="d2">Steven D. Wexner</data>
      <data key="d3">Not very long ago the treatment of faecal incontinence, now also referred to as ABL or accidental bowel leakage (1,2) was limited to sphincter repair, post anal repair, non-stimulated muscle transfers, stoma creation, antidiarrheal agents, bowel training with enemas, and antidiarrheal and bulking agents. During the last few decades we have witnessed the development of numerous new options. I think that it is easiest to categorize these options into repair, replacement, augmentation, stimulation, and diversion; the repair methods have not significantly changed including direct and overlapping anterior sphincter repair. The augmentation methods are new and include a variety of injectable agents the most widely used of which is NASHA-Dx (Salix Pharmaceuticals, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA) – a non animal stabilized hyaluronic acid dextranomer [3]. However, other newer methods are quite promising including Professor Carlo Ratto’s Gatekeeper – an implantable thin solid polyacrylonitrile cylinder [4] and Exantia (Promedon, Cordoba, Argentina) an injectable polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer [5], as championed by Dr. Guillermo Rosato, both of which have shown significant promise in initial pilot trials. The recommendation of all these augmentation methods is that they create a passive barrier akin to a modern day encirclement procedure. The only different option for augmentation is radiofrequency energy [6] delivery, which induces tissue remodeling as demonstrated in a prior publication in this journal by Professors Roman Herman and Mariana Berho [7]. The mechanism of action of radiofrequency appears to be sensory improvement rather than bulking and creating a type of outlet obstruction as is seen with the injectables. In the category of stimulation, sacral neuromodulation, like radiofrequency energy, also allows significant sensory changes. The team of Professor Ronan O’Connell and others have demonstrated afferent pathways causing cerebral pontine changes, as well as local milieu environmental differences in substance P and other agents which may well be responsible for the dramatic improvements seen consistently in numerous studies of sacral neuromodulation [8]. Since the afferent pathways may be more important than the efferent pathways in neuromodulation, much recent attention has been turned towards both transcutaneous and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. Professor Knowles et al. [9] recently published the CONFiDENT study in The Lancet unfortunately showing very little efficacy as compared to placebo blinded stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve. However, work still continues in this area. The replacement methods have morphed from nonstimulated muscle transfers to stimulated graciloplasty to the artificial bowel sphincter and most recently to the magnetic anal sphincter and slings [10–13]. Although Williams, Cavina, and Baeten all published very promising results of stimulated graciloplasty, due to a very high morbidity the technique has been largely abandoned and in fact for many years has been unavailable in the United States [14]. Sadly, the artificial bowel sphincter seems to have followed the same route and is also no longer available in the United States. However, Professor Lehur et al. [12] have shown that the new magnetic anal sphincter may be the the most effective substitute for the artificial bowel sphincter in replacement therapies. The TOPAS (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA) polypropylene implantable mesh sling has had a much shorter history but initial results seem reasonable [13]. Changes have even occurred in terms of diversion in that in addition to the traditional colostomy, the MACE (Malone Antegrade Continence Enema) procedure championed by Professor Williams is another viable option by which the patient need not wear an appliance but instead can irrigate to evacuate in an antegrade fashion. Even the colostomy itself has been improved upon by now being performed laparoscopically rather than through a laparotomy or a trephine. The well-known high incidence of parastomal hernia may potentially be reduced by routine mesh reinforcement at the time of stoma construction. Clearly given the perhaps surprisingly high incidence of faecal incontinence of almost 20% in females [1,2], I am confident that much more work will continue to be performed in improving the efficacy and range of treatments for this very distressing and disabling disorder. In the past there has been a succession of initially promising treatments, often adopted without a good evidence base, and later abandoned. Trials in this complex area are difficult and many patients are desperate. Several recent publications have attempted to improve our understanding, and direct our therapeutic alternatives in an individual tailored by patient basis [1,16].</data>

      <data key="d3">Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a highly heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders that are characterized by abnormal social interactions, communication deficits, and repetitive and restricted behaviors and interests. First defined as a disorder by Leo Kanner in the early 1940s, the incidence of ASD is climbing and has accelerated in the past few decades. Although the spectrum of the disorder is thought to be highly heritable, and may result from multigene susceptibility interactions, no single gene has been identified that can adequately explain the disorder’s complex heterogeneity and alarmingly increasing prevalence. Regardless, researchers have pinpointed many genetic variations [1], including genes involved in carnitine biosynthesis and glutamatergic transmission, which may augment susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD. Beaudet [2] put forward the hypothesis that an inactive copy of the TMLHE gene may contribute to an insufficient endogenous supply of carnitine, thereby increasing ASD risk. I argue here that these genetic variants may increase ASD risk, not directly, but by compromising endogenous mechanisms required to mitigate the effects of environmental exposures that I have previously implicated in ASD etiology and related neuropathology.</data>

The fragile Y hypothesis was formed after analysis of sex chromosomes in more than 4000 beetle species. Species in which XY segregation does not rely on recombination, and therefore chiasmata formation within a pseudoautosomal region (PAR), were less likely to have lost their Y chromosome than species in which XY segregation requires chiasmata formation. Y loss was especially evident for species with a small PAR, because a reduced PAR presents fewer opportunities for obligate chiasmata formation, increasing the production of sperm that lack a Y. Frequent Y aneuploidy results in selective pressure to remove genes that are critical for Y function. In the absence of critical function, existence of the Y is fragile. Blackmon and Demuth assign the fate of Ychromosomes to three outcomes: 1) Rejuvenation by addition of an autosome to the X and Y to extend the PAR, which results in greater opportunity for faithful chiasmata formation. Such an addition occurred in the placental mammal ancestor, which was perhaps fixed simply by selection for a reduced frequency of aneuploid sperm. However, PAR size was inevitably reduced again as recombination between new regions of the X and Yceased, so the burden of aneuploid sperm that lack a Y returned. In the absence of repeated autosomal additions to the X and Y, rejuvenation is only a temporary fix. 2) Long-term retention of the Yafter evolution of achiasmatic or asynaptic XY segregation. Because a diminished PAR is not required for accurate XY segregation, Y aneuploidy occurs less frequently. This diminishes pressure to remove critical Y chromosome function and, therefore, the chance of Y loss. In all marsupials there is asynaptic XYsegregation; and in rodents, achiasmatic sex chromosomes have evolved multiple times. As predicted by the fragile Y hypothesis there is no recorded loss of the Y chromosome in species with an altered meiotic strategy. 3) Loss. Unreliable chiasmata formation in a small PAR may result in erratic XYsegregation, and an increased frequecny of</data>

These premises guide current research when and how did (i) occur, and how did (i) lead to (ii)? In this issue of BioEssays, Speijer illuminates (i) by suggesting that the original symbiotic relationship was based on complementary energy-converting capabilities [1]. By this view, proto-mitochondria (relatives of modern alpha-proteobacteria) had the capability to build membrane potential by oxidizing substrate and reducing oxygen. When oxygen was unavailable, proto-mitochondrial electron carriers became highly reduced, and substrate remained incompletely oxidized by substrate-level phosphorylation. Enter the archaeal symbionts. These symbionts had the capability to build membrane potential by oxidizing substrate and reducing an alternative terminal electron acceptor, which was inhibited by oxygen. In this scenario, the symbiosis functioned very well in habitats with fluctuating oxygen availability. In the presence of oxygen, protomitochondria oxidized most of the available substrate and multiplied rapidly, while the archaeans were largely quiescent, subsisting on substrate-level phosphorylation. In the absence of oxygen, the roles were reversed. Exchange of partially oxidized intermediate metabolites could occur, funneling substrate into the working electron transport chain and diminishing the stress related to highly reduced electron carriers.

Let me first say that I always find his insights highly important and, in the overwhelming majority of cases, enlightening. I also thank him for this reaction, because it allows me to further highlight some crucial aspects of my proposal. So what is the real argument here? It is this: Are the examples of hydrogen production we find in quite a few different eukaryotic lineages “ancient” in that they always retained these genes for the synthesis of hydrogen, or “derived,” in that aerobic eukaryotes picked up the necessary genes at a (much) later date as they encountered hypoxic/anoxic environments (in many cases as part of a parasitic lifestyle)? William Martin thinks that at least some of them represent “the genuine article” (i.e., ancient adaptations), whereas I doubt this, and recent analyses do not make it likely either [4, 5]. Martin sees the existence of such organisms as representative of a primordial state in which the alphaproteobacterium (the future mitochondrion) alternated between using oxygen, producing water, and producing H2, which could be used by a methanogenic archaeon, the future host [3]. I think that even if this state did indeed exist, all traces would have been erased in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). see later.</data>

Indeed, in the cytoplasm alone, Ccr4‐Not regulates translational repression, decapping and deadenylation, and the Not module additionally plays a positive role in translation. The spatial distribution of the subunits within the structure is compatible with a model proposing that the Ccr4‐Not complex interacts with the 5′ and 3′ ends of target mRNAs, allowing different functional modules of the complex to act at different stages of the translation process, possibly within a circular constellation of the mRNA.

The Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease remains today incurable and concerns one in 2500 people in the United States or Europe. It is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of peripheral nerve disorders affecting axons and/or Schwann cells. It mostly leads to progressive loss of muscular strength, of touch sensation in the feet and in the hands and, thereafter, of coordination and balance. Although sporadic cases are reported, the disease is inherited following all types of genetic transmissions (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked). Presently, mutations within 70–100 genes (numbers vary depending on sources) have been directly correlated to one of the six main sub-types of CMT diseases.

Their thesis was that cancer cells can access an ancient, possibly prokaryote-originated, multi-layered stress response, culminating in sufficient genomic alteration to promote their survival. Commonly utilized chemotherapeutic drugs exemplified typical stressors, and the almost inevitable emergence of resistant clones was suggested to be the result of this ancient adaptive program. The authors believe that a better understanding of the mechanisms of this stress response might lead to additional strategies to circumvent this drug resistance. One consideration is whether this putative program is confined to cancer cells, or extends also to normal cells in metazoa, including the metazoa harboring a cancer. If the former, it would imply that carcinogenesis and the ensuingmalignant phenotype somehow have privileged access to this adaptive program, perhaps as an inherent feature of cancer, analogous to what had previously been suggested in this journal [2]. This remains an open question; but if, as proposed by Cipponi and Thomas, this program might be manipulated for therapeutic gain, then whether it is selective for cancer is key in the net effects on therapeutic index (the ratio of toxicity to efficacy), the most fundamental issue in the acceptability of any treatment.

The strongest argument that Speijer can muster against the view that the ancestral mitochondrion (or ancestral eukaryotes) were facultative anaerobes is found in his section entitled “Problems with assuming hydrogen exchange.” There he writes “But how could the future endosymbiont have retained its complex multi-subunit aerobic respiratory chain under prolonged anoxic conditions?

      <data key="d3">The holobiont has captured wide interest and provoked a medley of diverse research programmes. After all, the very notion of ‘individuals’ has been fundamentally challenged by the prevalence of symbiosis and the growing recognition of the importance attributed to mutualistic relationships. How symbiosis is established and then maintained has focused attention on immune tolerance, which heretofore has been understood in terms of thwarting the immune rejection either by (i) eliminating those T cells that would recognise ‘self’ constituents, or (ii) higher order inhibition effected by T-regulatory cells and other modulators of immune activation. A third mechanism pertains to microbes hiding their ‘foreign’ identities. While not strictly invoking immune regulation as such, this last means of avoiding immune attack may be the key to symbiotic entrenchment. But instead of camouflage, Root-Bernstein (2016) suggests mimicry, whereby the immune system selects bacterial species because they are ‘seen’ as self, not foreign, and that correspondence then allows for hospitable host-microbe co-existence [1]. This so-called ‘holoimmune’ hypothesis argues that symbiosis is mediated (at least in part) by shared hostmicrobiome antigens, where T-cell receptor (TCR)/antigenic mimicry creates a ‘molecular mirror’. If the genetic host and its microbiome reflect structurally similar ‘self’ epitopes, the symbionts would remain unrecognised, for, as noted, ‘self’ epitopes recognised by T</data>

      <data key="d3">The year 2015 brought a big surprise. Genomes of creatures composed of more than one cell were reported to carry N6methyldeoxyadenine (6mA), a modified nucleobase hitherto thought to be present for the most part only in bacterial DNA. If true, how would 6mA come to be present in DNA of reputable model organisms, including mice? And what would 6mA be doing there? These were the basic questions that Sun and colleagues explored in a paper published in BioEssays with the title “N6methyladenine functions as a potential epigenetic mark in eukaryotes.” The Hypotheses paper compared 6mA with the well-understood modified base 5-methyldeoxycytidine (5mC). The authors went on to speculate how a methyl group could be added to and removed from adenines and suggested where in the genome such processes might occur. Attention was called to genes that could be involved in 6mA-mediated epigenetic regulation. The premise of the paper’s hypothesis was “that DNA methylation plays conserved epigenetic roles in a wide array of organisms from bacteria to mammals.” Importantly, the authors continued, “if the DNA is not modified at cytosine, animals likely use other types of methylated bases, such as 6mA, to fulfill the related function of 5mC in mammals.” Ideas abound, but do they stand the test of time? Two years have gone by since they were put forward. 6mA certainly contributed to an “epigenetics gold rush” to discover novel base modifications in nucleic acids. Yet, little primary literature has been published about this particular chemical tag in animal DNA and this is puzzling. It is puzzling, because two widely used model organisms the worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) lack cytosine methylation and therefore would be ideally suited to test the hypothesis that 6mA steps in to do what 5mC normally does. It is puzzling, because both of these model organisms have short generation intervals, which permit quick genetic screens.

Cells have evolved several mechanisms to prevent aneuploidy, such as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The SAC prevents chromosome missegregation in mitosis by retaining cells in metaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to opposing spindle poles. While the SAC can prevent most mitotic abnormalities, it does not recognize merotelic attachments, in which one of the two sister chromatids is connected to both spindle poles. Such flawed attachments can lead to lagging chromosomes and aneuploid cells when unresolved. Two years ago, Maiato et al. proposed in BioEssays that in human cells a second checkpoint exists that delays chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope reassembly (NER) when chromosomes lag behind during anaphase [1]. Since then this chromosome separation checkpoint (CSC) was also described for Drosophila, suggesting it to be conserved between species [2].

In this quest, multidisciplinary teams of researchers have turned their attention to exploring the microbiomes of “traditional” human populations, that is, human groups worldwide that are still somewhat unaffected by urbanization and industrialized lifestyles. The findings indicate that industrialization and westernized lifestyles have greatly reduced bacterial diversity in the human gut, suggesting that increased sanitation and unhealthy diets are connected with these losses.

In contrast, few asexual lineages were successful over long evolutionary periods. The main reason asexuals failed to succeed and diversify is that most advantages of asexual reproduction (i.e. no cost of finding mates, passing all of your genes to your progeny insteadof half) are thought to be strongly outweighed by long-term disadvantages. Sex provides benefits by altering the association among alleles in the genome. New associations can either increase the variance in fitness in a population (e.g. bybreakingassociations of beneficial and deleterious mutations) or create more fit progeny by reshuffling alleles into new combinations (e.g. to escape a pathogen adapted to a common host genotype). Arguments for the benefits of sex were mainly supported by a strong theoretical framework. Now, a study by McDonald et al. [1] provided significant empirical evidence for the advantage of sex. By making use of engineered strains of the Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the study tracked the fate of sexual versus asexual populations during experimental evolution. Sexual populations gained a striking fitness advantage when compared to asexual populations over the course of the experiment.

This process necessitates mechanisms whereby stress can influence behavior, and processes through which the stress response can be modified. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the mechanisms whereby the stress response can be rapidly modified for an optimal response to stress in a context-dependent manner. A series of studies from the laboratory of Dr. Jaideep Bains has uncovered bidirectional plasticity at GABAergic synapses on parvocellular neuroendocrine cells (PNCs) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which govern the body’s physiological response to stress. The activity of PNCs and, thus, the HPA axis, is tightly regulated by GABAergic inhibition. Under non-stress conditions, GABA exerts inhibitory control over PNCs. However, following stress, the GABAergic constraint on corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) neurons is compromised due to a collapse of the chloride gradient. This collapse of the gradient results from Cl accumulation due to the dephosphorylation and downregulation of the Kþ/Cl co-transporter, KCC2 [1]. Thus, rapid alterations in the nature of GABAergic signaling facilitate the physiological response to stress. In addition, plasticity at GABAergic synapses also impacts the capacity for GABAergic control of PNCs. For</data>

Sch€ onkecht and co-workers [1] suggested that horizontal gene acquisitions by eukaryotes were drivers of adaptive evolution. Much of this analysis was based on the thermoacidophilic red alga Galderia sulphuraria whose adaptation to a hot, acidic, toxic environment was facilitated by the acquisition of several genes from Bacteria and Archaea.

      <data key="d3">Cilia and flagella (equivalent terms) are microtubule-based organelles projecting from the surface ofmany eukaryotic cell types, ranging from the green alga Chlamydomonas to humans. Cilia lack a protein synthesis machinery, and therefore assembly and maintenance of the ciliary microtubule core, the axoneme, require intraflagellar transport (IFT) mediated movement of tubulin from the cell body toward the ciliary tip. Trains of IFT particles carrying ciliary cargo travel from the ciliary base to its tip by kinesin-2 motors, while dynein-2 returns unloaded IFT particles to the ciliary base for recycling. Precisely how IFT mediates tubulin transport during axoneme extension was, until recently, unknown. However, in 2013 Bhogaraju and co-workers [1] provided important mechanistic insight into this process. IFT particles comprise IFT-A and IFT-B sub-complexes that contain about six and sixteen different polypeptides, respectively. Bhogaraju et al. showed that two IFT-B proteins, IFT74 and IFT81, form a tubulin binding module composed of a calponin homology (CH) domain in IFT81 and a highly basic domain in IFT74. Furthermore, IFT81 knock-down and rescue experiments with tubulin binding site mutants indicated that tubulin binding activity of IFT81 is at least partially required for ciliogenesis in human cells [1], but whether the IFT74/IFT81 module is the only tubulin cargo binding site within the IFT particle was unclear.</data>

      <data key="d3">The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is the subject of many hypotheses. One of them, proposed by Segreto and Deigin, assumes artificial chimeric construction of SARS‐CoV‐2 from a backbone of RaTG13‐like CoV and receptor binding domain (RBD) of a pangolin MP789‐like CoV, followed by serial cell or animal passage. Here we show that this hypothesis relies on incorrect or weak assumptions, and does not agree with the results of comparative genomics analysis. The genetic divergence between SARS‐CoV‐2 and both its proposed ancestors is too high to have accumulated in a lab, given the timeframe of several years. Furthermore, comparative analysis of S‐protein gene sequences suggests that the RBD of SARS‐CoV‐2 probably represents an ancestral non‐recombinant variant. These and other arguments significantly weaken the hypothesis of a laboratory origin for SARS‐CoV‐2, while the hypothesis of a natural origin is consistent with all available genetic and experimental data.</data>

      <data key="d3">There has been much work examining bioinspired mineralization of polymeric hydrogels with calcium phosphates, yet a systematic method for the predictable and tunable synthesis of biomimetic apatites is yet to be developed. Here, a method for the selective mineralization of substituted apatite composite hydrogels where the incorporated mineral phase is formed as a result of a chemical reaction within the hydrogel matrix is presented. Mineralized hydrogels are prepared by precipitating the apatite precursor phase dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) solution, which is then crosslinked into a composite hydrogel by cyclic freeze/thawing. The encapsulated DCPD is hydrolyzed to apatite by immersion in buffers at 37 °C. Tuning the pH (7.4, 9) and ionic composition (CO3 2−, F−) of the buffer influence the morphology and chemical composition of the apatite product. The incorporated calcium phosphate polymorph is monitored by X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray. The apatite–PVA hydrogels promote cellular adhesion and viability. The method developed here demonstrates diffusion-mediated transformation of a calcium phosphate precursor phase within a hydrogel matrix to various substituted apatites in a selective and predictable manner.</data>

      <data key="d3">Morris et al.[1] present us with an intriguing model that reconsiders the function of scaffold proteins. They propose that scaffolds control Rho signaling by influencing the kinetics of active Rho. RhoA regulates actomyosin filament assembly and contractility for cytokinesis and epithelial cell mechanics, among other processes.[2,3] These functions rely on effectors, which require sustained interactions with active RhoA, yet RhoA has a labile membrane association. Thus, scaffolds could facilitate signaling by increasing themembrane retention of active RhoA. Anillin is a scaffold protein that plays a central role in cytokinesis and maintenance of adherens junctions. Anillin contains an anillin homology domain (AHD) in its C-terminus with an RhoA-GTP binding domain (RBD) and a Ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting (C2) domain that binds cooperatively to active RhoA and PI4,5P2 in vitro.[4] Anillin also has a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to phospholipids and septins. Morris et al.[1] propose that the AHD recruits and increases the residence time of active RhoA long enough to support interactions with effectors that are required for assembling and controlling actomyosin filaments (e.g., Rho kinase). This model is consistent with previous findings where, although anillin requires active RhoA for its cortical recruitment, it feeds back to stabilize active RhoA at the equatorial plane for cytokinesis.[3] To reconcile that anillin and effectors bind to the same residues on RhoA, yet anillin enhances RhoA-effector interactions, Morris et al.[1] point out that anillin binds to RhoA with relatively weak affinity compared to the other effectors. Therefore, anillin would be out-competed by the effectors to promote versus inhibit their function. Morris et al.[1] also consider how “free” RhoA could remain sequestered in a defined zone, despite its low affinity for anillin. Both anillin and RhoA require lipid-binding for their function, and studies showed that anillin could induce the clustering of PI4,5P2 to create nanodomains.[5] These PI4,5P2 nanodomains could sequester anillin-RhoA complexes where RhoA can go through repeated cycles of binding, dissociation, and re-binding to anillin, leading to an increased likelihood of RhoA-effector engagement. In this way, Morris et al.[1] propose that anillin functions as a kinetic</data>

      <data key="d3">During the pandemic, interactions with students had to be from a distance. This got me to think about biases in assessments. In one of the courses, students had to reflect on a technically difficult “Omics” paper, answering questions and giving critical feedback. As individual student-teacher interactions had to be quite minimal, I ended up with a bunch of documents with “faceless” names. In the process of marking different student’s valiant efforts I noticed that, unsurprisingly, names still automatically conjured up faces, as names contain information regarding gender and ethnicity. Of course, I try to combat conscious prejudice. But “ay, there’s the rub”: only a fool would deny unconscious prejudices. I am far from the first to notice that all kinds of (un)conscious biases pervade our (digital) work environment. Some can be more easily circumvented than others. In the case of my exams, a simple intermediary program removing all personal information and generating a random number, would do the trick. Could such an intake system also be of use in publishing, as is currently being tried out by some publishing start-ups (or should I say “upstarts”?). Oneobjectionmight be that there are real benefits to how the system currently operates. Aren’t the “top” researchers better known for a reason? Overall, they produce higher quality work, so they should have easier access towidely read journals. Also, lesser known scientists making grandiose claims: should these indeed not be looked at more critically? Thus, it is reasoned, the identity of the people and the institute responsible for the paper just gives another valid criterion to base assessment on. On the other hand, high quality work should be able to stand on its own, and grandiose claims should always bemetwith skepticism, irrespective of the identity of the claimant. But maybe we should first ask: is there even a real problem? I am afraid the answer is a qualified yes. Most scientists I have talked with (even the ones it benefits) detect a strong Matthew principle operating in science. Especially junior researchers from lesser known groups should have a better chance of publishing in high impact journals. The higher your scientific status, the easier it becomes to get published in the top journals, giving you a crucial advantage in quickly getting your message out, influencing the future direction of science as well as your careerwithin it. Thiswill lead toboth “overrated” and “underrated” articles. The first outcome I consider no big deal, but the second I consider really detrimental to scientific progress. Let me illustrate from indirect personal experience. In the nineties I was working on my PhD, often using BlueNativeGel Electrophoresis (BNE) to characterizemitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, a technique pioneered by Schägger and von Jagow.[1] Using the same technique in a different research project, I often shared the lab late at night with Leo Nijtmans, who under the supervision of Coby van den Bogert, was doing something I considered revolutionary. He studied the assembly of complex IV, cytochrome-c oxidase, in the presence of inhibitors of eithermitochondrial or cytosolic protein synthesis, by metabolic labelling of a human leukemia cell line, followed by BNE, classical SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis. This allowed the first ever identification of assembly intermediates of complex IV.[2] His supervisor who was still building her own research group at the time, became gravely ill and sadly died before the paperwas published. Leo and I noticed the tremendous difficulty in getting the paper accepted and, in the end, he had to “settle” for the European Journal of Biochemistry (now the FEBS Journal), which did not have the impact factor we thought the paper deserved. A current Google Scholar citations number approaching 300 (!) rather supports our initial assessment, I would say. Leo would go on to research and describe (in great detail) the biogenesis of the, even more complicated, first respiratory complex, NADH dehydrogenase.[3] Alas, after contributing a lot to our understanding of the biogenesis of mitochondrial respiration complexes, Leo also died, much too early, in 2018. I sometimes wonder if he would have had an even greater impact if article selection and acceptance would have beenmore unbiased when he started out. So, how can we level the playing field? I think the problem is most pronounced with the absolute top-tier journals, so their editorial staffs and reviewers might indeed benefit from procedures and training to root out the detrimental effects of the Matthew principle. Then again, there are some pretty good journals out there that seem to be less afflicted. By submitting to these we could initiate a process of extending, instead of just levelling, the playing field.</data>

Our study extends earlier fundamental RG studies by Chubukov et al. [Phys. Rev. B 78, 134512 (2008)] by allowing the flowing interactions to be orbital‐dependent. While for small inter‐orbital repulsion U′ , we retrieve the previous picture of a constructive interplay between antiferromagnetic spin‐density wave ordering and sign‐changing s‐wave pairing, for larger U′ , dxz/yz ’“nematic” orbital ordering becomes strong and changes the groundstate of the undoped or slightly doped system qualitatively. At the transition between the two regimes, both sign‐changing pairing and sign‐changing dxz/yz ‐nematic are most pronounced. Our results suggest a much richer range of possibilities for the ground states of iron superconductors and related materials and shows how nematic order can act as an additional source for unconventional Cooper pairing. For the strongly electron‐doped case without hole pockets we also find a novel pairing that has no sign‐change as function of the wavevector but changes sign between the dxy and the dxz/yz orbitals.</data>

      <data key="d3">It has become apparent that difficulties to replicate telomeres concern not only the very ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. The challenges already start when the replication fork enters the telomeric repeats. The obstacles encountered consist mainly of noncanonical nucleic acid structures that interfere with replication if not resolved. Replication stress at telomeres promotes the formation of so‐called fragile telomeres displaying an abnormal appearance in metaphase chromosomes though their exact molecular nature remains to be elucidated. A substantial number of factors is required to counteract fragility. In this review we promote the hypothesis that telomere fragility is not caused directly by an initial insult during replication but it results as a secondary consequence of DNA repair of damaged replication forks by the homologous DNA recombination machinery. Incomplete DNA synthesis at repair sites or partial chromatin condensation may become apparent as telomere fragility. Fragility and DNA repair during telomere replication emerges as a common phenomenon which exacerbates in multiple disease conditions.</data>

      <data key="d3">Solid oxide fuel cell electrodes with directional properties have shown their potential to get the maximum electrochemical reaction sites, gas diffusivity and ionic conductivity, simultaneously. New manufacturing methods, like freeze type casting, have used to make this kind on electrodes. In this work, the effect of backbone directional behavior in infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was simulated. A series of directional backbones were generated by a statistical method and analyzed in regard of available active surface density and phase tortuosity. Different amount of electrocatalyst particles virtually deposited on the surface of those scaffolds. Some geometric parameters like triple phase boundary (TPB) density, active surface density of particles and the pore tortuosity were extracted from those realized models. The simulations showed that the optimum amount of infiltration to get the maximum TPB density or active surface density of impregnated particles can be varied depend on the porosity and geometric anisotropy of scaffolds. Being directional in backbones, normal to the electrolyte, has a positive effect on active electrochemical sites especially active surface density of deposited particles. Also it can improve the gas transport even in low porosity microstructures, but adding electrocatalyst particles may increase the pore tortuosity considerably. Accordingly, directional backbones have the potential of increasing the performance of infiltrated electrodes via adding electrochemical sites and gas diffusivity.</data>

      <data key="d3">The human body represents a scaffold upon which a multitude of mutualistic and symbiotic species build a residence, creating a diverse ecosystem composed of bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi, and viruses. In this focus issue of BioEssays, members of CIFAR’s Humans &amp; the Microbiome program explore how human existence is impacted by the microbiome. Microbes are the dominant life form on our planet. Studying them in the context of their human hosts is changing the way we view microbial and human diversity, evolution, and biology. The research of microbial communities inhabiting human epithelia and organs has progressed at a spectacular rate over the past five years. This progress is due in large part to the application of “metagenomic” methods: a series of experimental and computational approaches that allow a microbial community’s composition to be defined by DNA sequencing without having to culture its members. This work has yielded catalogs of microbial species, many previously unknown and belonging to all three domains of life, as well as lists of millions of microbial genes collectively known as our “microbiome.” Research on host–microbe interactions has become an emerging cross‐disciplinary field. A complex microbiome confers immunological, metabolic, and behavioral properties. Its disturbance can affect many aspects of human health, disease, and society. CIFAR’s Humans &amp; the Microbiome program is a multidisciplinary group of biological, clinical, and social scientists who deeply explore the links between microbiome biology and sociocultural, historical, evolutionary, and environmental aspects of human existence that may impact the microbiome or be impacted by it. Program members think outside the “safety” of their disciplines and methodologies and are increasingly expanding their research to new areas by applying multidisciplinary approaches to their work. This interdisciplinary dialogue between philosophers, anthropologists, natural scientists, and clinical scientists promises to transform the study of the human microbiome and the biological, social, and health sciences. The interdisciplinary conversations and collaboration have led microbiologists to a greater understanding of the context of historical changes that have shaped the human microbiome; social scientists have developed a greater understanding of the relationships between microbes and their environment, as well as the place of humans in the environment from the perspective of self and community. In this focus issue of BioEssays, members of CIFAR’s Humans &amp; the Microbiome program focus on topics ranging from decoding the link between nutrition, the microbiome and human developmental, metabolic, and immune health and aging, to understanding past changes in the environment and microbiome. They also remind us that Nature has provided researchers with many model systems to uncover the role of the microbiome in evolution. In an essay written by a biologist, a clinical scientist, and an anthropologist‐historian and philospher, Bauer et al. report how bacteria‐to‐brain interactions expand our concept of the nervous system, highlighting ongoing challenges and recommendations for emerging gut microbiota–brain research. An essay written by a biologist, a clinical scientist, a medical researcher, and a social scientist (Finlay et al.) discusses the unexpected beneficial effects of microbes on aged animals—findings that point to an even more complex interplay between the gut microbiome and the host. Bosch et al. suggest that new knowledge of the diversity of host–microbe interactions found across the animal kingdom will provide new insights into how animals develop, evolve, and manifest disease. Geva‐Zatorsky et al. present an overview and a perspective on the social, molecular, and health‐related interactions that humans have with their microbial residents. In an essay written by a biological anthropologist, an anthropologist‐historian, and a clinical scientist, Amato et al. construct the human microbiome through evolution by discussing how changes in host diet, environment, and physiology have altered microbial community composition and functions, and consequently, their effect on human disease and health. Together, these essays emphasize both the challenges faced when analyzing microbiome data and the shortcomings of a discipline‐specific approach. They demonstrate that we can broaden and change our understanding of how humans interface with the world via the microbiome by fostering interactions and discussions between disciplines that normally do not speak with each other.

      <data key="d3">If you’re interested in living a healthy, long life, mere calorie restriction probably won’t do much for you. But wait! Before you impulsively dash to the fridge to gobble up a whole pot of artificially sweetened yoghurt with a freshly cleared conscience, and resolved simply to enjoy your remaining mortal days it’s more complicated than that. Sorry, but this is, after all, biology that we’re talking about. Increasing, epidemiological and sociological evidence, and critical examination of calorie restriction experiments, are combining to give a more scientifically-founded explanation for the “obesity epidemic” afflicting wealthy nations. Here’s the bottom line: It’s likely to be eating habits and the type of diet associated with them, not the calories per se, that threaten to curtail many people’s lives short of their potential span. It’s the way we eat and what we eat. First to the way: humans face a serious risk to health in having food constantly available, increasingly advertised, and ever less associated with regular eating times. Basically this is a type of industrially encouraged ad libitum feeding regime. What’s the connexion with calorie-restriction studies? Having covered the risks of simplistically translating results from calorie restriction in animal models into personal eating habits in our previous issue, Le Bourg is back with a “Think again” article in this issue that basically forces us to examine the negative effects of ad libitum feeding. Herein is the reasoned claim that the seeming life extension effect of calorie restriction in laboratory animal studies is more likely to be due a lowered life expectancy in the ad libitum-fed control groups. Animals in this setting escape the predation, natural accidents, andmost of the disease burden that wild animals suffer; however, if Le Bourg is right, the control group can’t profit as much from these advantages as the calorierestricted one, because ad libitum feeding is not healthy for them. These ad libitum fed diets at least contain foodstuffs that are species-appropriate. In the human population, by contrast, that is highly questionable. And so to the what. Industrialized wealthy nations are increasingly eating foodstuffs laced with refined carbohydrates and carbohydrates with high glycemic indexes (put crudely, that rapidly enter into the blood as monosaccharides, and hence have high insulin-releasing potential). George Monbiot’s analysis, drawing on published peer reviewed literature, claims that today’s obesity-prone populations are not eating more calories</data>

      <data key="d1">2023</data>
      <data key="d2">Salvatore Spicuglia; Alvaro Rada‐Iglesias</data>
      <data key="d3">In multicellular organisms, spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression is crucial for development, cellular differentiation, and homeostasis. Cell-type-specific regulation of gene expression is achieved through the interaction between regulatory elements that are either proximal (promoters) or distal (enhancers, silencers, insulators) to gene transcription start sites (TSSs). Enhancers, which primarily function in a cell type-specific manner, are short (100– 1000 bp) DNA sequences that contain binding sites for transcription factors and increase the expression of their target genes in cis. Four decades after their first discovery, enhancers are now widely considered key elements in the spatiotemporal control of gene expression underlying human development and homeostasis. Furthermore, enhancers play a significant role in disease, evolution, and phenotypic diversity. From a medical point of view, accumulating evidence indicate that a wide spectrum of human disorders, known as enhanceropathies, are influenced by enhancer malfunction caused by genetic, structural, or epigenetic alterations. These processes can directly cause cancer or Mendelian disorders, while they can also underpin the susceptibility to many common diseases. Despite recent advances in our understanding of enhancer biology and function, our capacity to foresee how enhancer dysfunction affects gene expression and, thus, human disease, is still limited. Therefore, elucidating the molecular basis of enhancer function in healthy and disease states has far-reaching translational implications, as it can help improving the diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of a broad range of human disorders. Despite their functional and medical relevance, there are fundamental questions about enhancers that remain unsolved: (i) what is an enhancer?; (ii) how does an enhancer control gene expression?; (ii) how do enhancers specifically control the expression of their target genes?; (iv) what are the different pathomechanisms whereby enhancers can contribute to human disease?. In this focus issue of BioEssays, several experts in the fields of functional genomics,medical genetics, andbioinformatics, discuss these important issues, which need to be addressed to fully understand the role of enhancer dysfunction in disease. What is an enhancer and how it controls gene expression? Enhancers can be defined in different ways depending on the methods used to identify them. On the one hand, operational definitions are based either on the ability of a given region to enhance transcription in a reporter assay or to harbor biochemical marks associated with enhancer activity. On the other hand, the biological definition requires that a distally-located DNA sequence regulates the transcription of a cis-located gene, in its native in vivo context. Although there is a fair overlap between these assays, operational-defined enhancers are not necessarily functioning in their endogenous context and vice versa. In a “Problems &amp; Paradigms” essay Thomas and Buecker discuss the different types of enhancers and the methods to identify them (https://doi. org/10.1002/bies.202300044).Higgs and colleagues illustratehowthe detailed characterization of the enhancers involved in the regulation of the α-globin gene cluster, a model locus involved in α-thalassemia, has provided important lessons about the molecular basis of enhancer function (https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202300047). How do enhancers specifically control the expression of their target genes? It is often assumed that distal enhancers have to come into physical proximity to their target gene in order to function. However, not all enhancers seem to establish physical contact with their target genes and, thus, alternative regulatory mechanisms might also exist. Furthermore, enhancers and their target genes often occupy the same regulatory domains, which enables specific enhancer-gene communicationand theestablishmentof appropriate geneexpressionprograms. Thus, a major challenge is to understand the mechanisms controlling the interplay between enhancers and other regulatory elements, including promoters and insulators, and how the joint activity of a regulatory domain is influenced by disruptions of individual enhancers. Two essays of this focus issue discuss the role of the nuclear organization in the control of gene expression. Plewczynski and collaborators review the role of the cohesin complex in the regulationof higher-order chromatin structure, as well, as the experimental and bioinformatic methods to assess the 3D organization of the genome (https://doi. org/10.1002/bies.202200240). Zippo and collaborators describe how by studying proteins mutated in a group of rare Mendelian diseases known as chromatinopathies, it is possible to gain important insights into the role of chromatin condensates and the genome’s spatial organization in enhancer function and human disease (https://doi.org/10. 1002/bies.202300075). Which are the different pathomechanismswhereby enhancers can contribute to human disease? As mentioned above, enhancer dysfunction has emerged as a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of certain diseases. In particular, point mutations or structural variants that affect enhancer function can lead to pathological changes in gene expression that are directly involved in the etiology of several human cancers and Mendelian diseases. Moreover, the large majority of genetic variants associated with common diseases are found within cis-regulatory elements, including enhancers. In this context, genetic variation at Epromoters, a new type of cis-regulatory element harboring both promoter and enhancer functions, are thought to play pleiotropic roles in disease</data>

      <data key="d2">Arunas L. Radzvilavicius</data>
      <data key="d3">p o n d e n c e Sir, In their recent Bioessays article, Havird et al. [1] proposed a novel hypothesis for the evolution of eukaryotic sex in which mitochondrial mutations play a key role. The authors argue that due to its inherently high evolution rate and inefficient selection, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rapidly accumulates deleterious mutations, prompting the evolution of compensatory nuclear modifications that could maintain cell’s viability. Recombination among nuclear chromosomes would increase the rate at which new combinations of compensatory alleles are introduced, saving eukaryotic lineages from the negative effects of mitochondrial genome erosion. The idea that the origin of sex has to do with the rapid evolution of interacting genomes is not new. In what is now known as the “Red Queen” hypothesis, Jaenike and Hamilton proposed that meiotic recombination might have evolved as a defense strategy against parasitic infections, as it breaks up ineffective resistance-allele combinations and rapidly generates new ones.

      <data key="d3">Somatic diversification of antigen receptor genes depends on the activity of enzymes whose homologs participate in a mutagenic DNA repair in unicellular species. Indeed, by engaging error‐prone polymerases, gap filling molecules and altered mismatch repair pathways, lymphocytes utilize conserved components of genomic stress response systems, which can already be found in bacteria and archaea. These ancient systems of mutagenesis and repair act to increase phenotypic diversity of microbial cell populations and operate to enhance their ability to produce fit variants during stress. Coopted by lymphocytes, the ancient mutagenic processing systems retained their diversification functions instilling the adaptive immune cells with enhanced evolvability and defensive capacity to resist infection and damage. As reviewed here, the ubiquity and conserved character of specialized variation‐generating mechanisms from bacteria to lymphocytes highlight the importance of these mechanisms for evolution of life in general.</data>

      <data key="d3">Slit‐based photoacoustic tomography is a newly developed technique that improves the elevation numerical aperture of a linear array through acoustic diffraction. The slit, placed at the acoustic focus of a linear array, effectively forms an array of virtual detectors with high receiving angle, which subsequently improves the elevation resolution. However, due to the complex implementation, our original system could only image phantoms and sacrificed animals. In this report, the system has been significantly improved. In particular, we designed a slit holder that can be directly mounted to the transducer array for easy adjustment of slit width and simultaneous scanning of both the array and the slit. To enlarge the imaging field of view, we replaced the single circular optical fiber bundle with a bifurcated line fiber bundle which moved simultaneously with the array and the slit. The data acquisition system has also been updated to double the imaging speed. With these improvements, the new system can image a 3.8 × 4 cm2 region within 40 seconds and the object only needs to be coupled through ultrasound gel. We successfully used the system to image vasculatures in the palm and forearm of human volunteers. 3D palm vascular image of human palm.</data>

      <data key="d3">Lithium ion batteries have proven to be a widely used power source for many commercial applications. The use of these cells is growing in higher capacity applications such as electric vehicle (EV) and power storage for renewable energy sources. With this increasing demand for higher capacity comes an increased demand for safer cells and systems. Among the safety issues associated with lithium-ion batteries, thermal stability of the cell components (anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator) has the largest impact on overall cell safety. There have been many developments towards inherently safer batteries. Many of these developments involve the use of additives to increase stability of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), increase ionic conductivity, reduce electrolyte flammability, and increase onset temperatures for thermal breakdown during cell runaway. These methods have proven effective to incrementally increase cell stability and overall safety, but have yet to provide dramatic benefits. The salt LiF has been shown to be a very stable and safe electrolyte for use in lithium-ion batteries. The difficulty with this salt is that it does not dissolve in standard carbonate based electrolytes. We have developed an electron acceptor compound, which can be used to directly solubilize LiF in carbonate electrolytes. This anion binding agent (ABA) not only allows for the use of the stable LiF electrolyte salt, but also increases the thermal stability of the cell. Figure 1 shows a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) comparison of two identical LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) battery cathodes tested using standard 3:7 EC:EMC (w/w) with 1.2 M LiPF6 electrolyte and 3:7 EC:EMC (w/w) with 1 M LiF and 1 M ABA. The overall heat output of the cathode using the ABA electrolyte formulation is reduced by ~ 30% as compared to the standard LiPF6 based electrolyte.</data>

Neural circuits performing sensorimotor computation to drive navigation employ inhibitory control as a gating mechanism as they hierarchically transform (multi)sensory information into motor actions. Here, the focus is on this literature to critically discuss the proposition that prominent inhibitory projections form sensorimotor circuits. After reviewing the neural circuits of navigation across various invertebrate species, it is argued that with increased neural circuit complexity and the emergence of parallel computations, inhibitory circuits acquire new functions. The contribution of inhibitory neurotransmission for navigation goes beyond shaping the communication that drives motor neurons, and instead includes encoding of emergent sensorimotor representations. A mechanistic understanding of the neural circuits performing sensorimotor computations in invertebrates will unravel the minimum circuit requirements driving adaptive navigation.</data>

The films were directly grown on quartz glass and amorphous-carbon-coated graphite substrates by a molecular beam epitaxy apparatus which has dual nitrogen plasma cells. Co-supplying of indium and gallium with simultaneous operation of the dual nitrogen plasma cells brought isolated and nano-pillar-shaped structures to the films. On the other hand, such structures were not obtained when the films were grown by the single plasma cell operation. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of the films greatly depended upon the morphologies. The intensities of the PL peaks emitted from the films which have such nano-pillar shaped structures were quite intense although the peak energies shifted to lower energy sides compared with those of the films grown by the single plasma cell operation.

      <data key="d3">The phenomenon of phase separation, the formation of highly concentrated regions of proteins and nucleic acids that have no separating membrane, is now recognised as an important mechanism for regulating gene expression through enhancer function. The ‘RNA polymerase II (PolII) transfer model’ was proposed as a mechanism for transcriptional activation at enhancers (for a definition of terms, please see Box 1).[1] The model specifically addresses how enhancers increase gene expression via phase separation, relying on transient transcription at enhancers to facilitate early release of transcription complexes. The model postulated that elongation-competent transcription complexes are assembled at enhancers during transcription of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). These complexes are subsequently released in a dephosphorylated form and sequestered to the promoter via condensation, providing a model for initiation of gene transcription through phase separation at enhancers.[1] Although intriguing, at the time the model lacked supporting data. Here, we evaluate the PolII transfer model as a mechanism for enhancer condensate gene expression, in light of recent advances.</data>

      <data key="d2">W. Reid Bolus</data>
      <data key="d3">In this issue of BioEssays, the article by Knights et al. provides a well-written dissection of the current knowledge gaps in the Immunometabolism field concerning the role of eosinophils in adipose tissue (AT) homeostasis and whole-body metabolism. Though it does not exhaustively describe all published studies on eosinophils in AT, it highlights several key studies to illustrate the field’s progression. The authors acknowledge that AT eosinophil function, not just number, needs to be more thoroughly investigated. With obesity and its comorbidities affecting a third of the US population and quickly rising world-wide, the study of AT has become more pertinent than ever. AT is now recognized as an important endocrine organ that stores and supplies the body with adequate energy, secretes hormones to influence vital processes such as hunger and energy expenditure, and stabilizes body temperature through insulation and thermogenesis. Obesity impairs AT function, due in part to a massive inflammatory overhaul. While the most prominent immunemodulation in AT during obesity is macrophage number and inflammatory state, many other immune cells are known to be altered, such as eosinophils. The study of AT eosinophils is less than a decade old with the first publication noting the presence of eosinophils in AT as recent as 2011. Since then a series of publications have shown positive effects of eosinophils on AT function, including weight loss, reduced AT inflammation, improved AT insulin sensitivity, and increased whole body glucose tolerance. However, not all publications have shown a positive role for eosinophils in AT health, thoroughly discussed in. For example, in the piece that this brief commentary accompanies, Knights et al. contemplate the implications of a recent paper from our lab in which elevating AT eosinophils did not rescue metabolic impairments during obesity. Knights and colleagues discuss the important new concept that eosinophil expression profiles should be examined since increasing eosinophils alone does not always improve AT health. In line with this thinking, our lab has been curious to determine if AT eosinophils exist on an E1/E2 spectrum, akin to M1/M2macrophage polarization and Th1 and Th2 T cells. Some evidence supports our idea of an E1/E2 spectrum: while eosinophils classically polarize M2-like</data>

      <data key="d3">The ovarian reserve defines female reproductive lifespan, which in humans spans decades. The ovarian reserve consists of oocytes residing in primordial follicles arrested in meiotic prophase I and is maintained independent of DNA replication and cell proliferation, thereby lacking stem cell‐based maintenance. Largely unknown is how cellular states of the ovarian reserve are established and maintained for decades. Our recent study revealed that a distinct chromatin state is established during ovarian reserve formation in mice, uncovering a novel window of epigenetic programming in female germline development. We showed that an epigenetic regulator, Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), establishes a repressive chromatin state in perinatal mouse oocytes that is essential for prophase I‐arrested oocytes to form the ovarian reserve. Here we discuss the biological roles and mechanisms underlying epigenetic programming in ovarian reserve formation, highlighting current knowledge gaps and emerging research areas in female reproductive biology.</data>

      <data key="d3">During the early Cambrian period metazoan life forms diverged at an accelerated rate to occupy multiple ecological niches on earth. A variety of explanations have been proposed to address this major evolutionary phenomenon termed the “Cambrian explosion.” While most hypotheses address environmental, developmental, and ecological factors that facilitated evolutionary innovations, the biological basis for accelerated emergence of species diversity in the Cambrian period remains largely conjectural. Herein, we posit that morphogenesis by self‐organization enables the uncoupling of genomic mutational landscape from phenotypic diversification. Evidence is provided for a two‐tiered interpretation of genomic changes in metazoan animals wherein mutations not only impact upon function of individual cells, but also alter the self‐organization outcome during developmental morphogenesis. We provide evidence that the morphological impacts of mutations on self‐organization could remain repressed if associated with an unmet negative energetic cost. We posit that accelerated morphological diversification in transition to the Cambrian period has occurred by emergence of dormant (i.e., reserved) morphological novelties whose molecular underpinnings were seeded in the Precambrian period.</data>

      <data key="d3">The inherent ‘intelligence’ of cancer cells to survive under adverse conditions makes cancer a difficult disease to cure. In this issue of BioEssays, Kolodny et al. hypothesize the use of an array of radiolabeled small molecules (RSMs) to target unique proteins present in cancer cells of the patient. This is in contrast to the use of a single peptide to target a single type of receptor protein on cancer cells. RSMs unleash a multipronged attack on several cellular targets, and hence could offer better therapeutic efficacy. Being small molecules (SMs), in vivo distribution to target cells, and elimination from normal cells, will be quicker, thus producing diagnostic images with excellent target/non-target ratio, and therapy with lower radiation toxicity to off-target organs. Use of DNA-encoded SM libraries (DELs) for drug discovery is not novel. However, applying this approach for the selection of target specific SMs with pendant side arms suitable for appending radioisotope tags for radiation therapy application is innovative. The hypothesis proposes interrogation of DEL members with proteins, both intracellular and membranebound, extracted from the surgically removed primary cancer cell samples of the patient. The DNA encoded SMs (DESMs) bound to the cancer cell proteins in the primary selection process undergo a counter selection process with proteins extracted from the normal tissue of the same patient. The result by subtraction is a set of DESMs specific to cancer cell proteins only. The authors propose further refinement of this ensemble to reduce non-specific binding and to improve specificity to cancer cell proteins by further selection and counter selection cycles. At any stage, the DNA-codes of the selected SMs are useful for amplifying the mixture to compensate for the losses and enable several such selection cycles. The customized DELs proposed in this work incorporate a photo-cleavable linkage to detach theDNA-tag prior to application. The authors envisage incorporating an alkynyl arm at one end of the SMs to append a flurophore or a radioisotope for imaging or therapy. The preference for employing radiation therapy over the conventional drug therapy is justified for several reasons. While conventional drug therapy depends on the drug interfering</data>

      <data key="d2">Michael Bies; Zachary Ashmore; Wenchun Qu; Christine Hunt</data>
      <data key="d3">BACKGROUND
Neuropathic pain is a complex condition that can be refractory to conventional management and can cause persistent suffering in patients. Current pharmacologic treatments can provide temporary symptomatic relief; however, the mechanism of these therapies does not address the underlying cause of neuropathic pain. The use of injectable biologics for neuropathic pain has multiple proposed mechanisms for analgesia including attenuation of inflammatory mediated processes, arrest or delay of the degenerative process, inhibition of apoptotic pathways, and augmentation of the survival and recovery of injured and uninjured nerves.


STUDY DESIGN
A systematic review of human studies involving the use of injectable biologics for neuropathic pain.


METHODS
A comprehensive search of several data bases including Ovid MEDLINE ® and Epub Ahead of Print, In Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, and Ovid Embase from inception to November 24, 2020.


RESULTS
The initial search yielded 3,450 studies with an additional 6 studies identified through other resources. Twenty-seven studies were included after independent review by two of the investigators. The included studies assessed the efficacy of injectable biologics for the treatment of neuropathic pain defined as pain reduction. Secondary outcome measures included functional improvement as well as safety of the procedures. A qualitative assessment of the literature without meta-analysis was performed due to the heterogeneity of the data.


CONCLUSION
According to the GRADE criteria, there is very low certainty of evidence in support of the efficacy of injectable biologics for treatment of neuropathic pain. Future efforts should focus on creating a standardized methodology and study design with respect to preparation, dosage and route of administration of biologics. This will serve as a catalyst for higher quality randomized trials with generation of more useful data to help drive informed clinical decision-making.</data>

In one way or another, I’ve been observing developments at the interfaces of research, public perception and policy for almost 20 years; and one of the things that I’ve noticed is that the concepts of research and science are largely seen as the same by people across a large spectrum of society, including researchers themselves. At first it might seem like a trivial point, but I believe that the distinction between the two is important for the future of humankind. The popular perception of a scientist is someone who is qualified as a scientist by virtue of doing research possibly even inferring direction of causality: research creates a scientist. One problem that this perception creates is that of exclusivity the “them and us” culture: only someone who has a research career can be a scientist. Another problem is that it misrepresents the meaning of “scientist” and the connexion between science and research, hence cementing the first problem. The truth of the matter is that to be a successful researcher, one must be a successful scientist, not the reverse. A scientist is someone who “knows” (12th century from Latin scientia “knowledge, a knowing; expertness” from online etymology http://www.etymonline. com, accessed on 01.09.2017), and in this specific sense, the knowledge is that of knowing/understanding how things work.

      <data key="d3">Why do cells age? Recent advances show that the cytoplasm is organized into many membrane‐less compartments via a process known as phase separation, which ensures spatiotemporal control over diffusion‐limited biochemical reactions. Although phase separation is a powerful mechanism to organize biochemical reactions, it comes with the trade‐off that it is extremely sensitive to changes in physical‐chemical parameters, such as protein concentration, pH, or cellular energy levels. Here, we highlight recent findings showing that age‐related neurodegenerative diseases are linked to aberrant phase transitions in neurons. We discuss how these aberrant phase transitions could be tied to a failure to maintain physiological physical‐chemical conditions. We generalize this idea to suggest that the process of cellular aging involves a progressive loss of the organization of phase‐separated compartments in the cytoplasm.</data>

      <data key="d3">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may not be a multifactorial disease; it can be hypothesized that RA is developed through a series of events following a triggering event, which is the emergence of a chemokine for neutrophils in the synovium. IL‐17A, secreted by infiltrated neutrophils, stimulates synoviocytes to produce CCL20, which attracts various CCR6‐expressing cells, including Th17 cells. Monocytes (macrophages) appear after neutrophil infiltration according to the natural course of inflammation and secrete IL‐1β and TNFα. Then, IL‐17A, IL‐1β, and TNFα stimulate synoviocytes to produce CCL20, amplifying the inflammation. Varieties of chemokines secreted by infiltrating cells accumulate in the synovium and induce synoviocyte proliferation by binding to the corresponding G protein‐coupled receptors, thus expanding the synovial tissue. CCL20 in this tissue attracts circulating monocytes that express both CCR6 and receptor activator of NF‐κB (RANK), which differentiate into osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL. In this way, pannus is formed, and bone destruction begins.</data>

It sounds so simple, and the concept is, indeed, simple, but when the chips are down, and plan A is not going to plan after all, you are suddenly faced with the cold reality of having no safety net.

You could, of course, start two research projects in parallel, but that would compromise your chances of making optimal progress on both of them, and unless both of the projects are rather off the beaten track, so to speak, you run a big risk of being beaten by some other research group. Furthermore, this is really just a case of having a project A and a project B, rather than a strategic model for reallocation of efforts and change of direction. One of the classic challenges of research is that it often involves an all-out effort to solve a really significant problem or open question, and hence make a noteworthy mark in the literature.

      <data key="d3">As one pathogen, a virus of the Orthocoronavirinae family (SARS-CoV-2, or the agent of COVID-19), took its hold on humanity, another started to loosen its grip. The latter was Dataproducus compulsivans[1]—the infectious agent responsible for severe obsessive result-generation syndrome (SORS). D. compulsivans had evaded all efforts to produce a vaccine against it: the pathogen could not be cultured outside the human body; rather the culture medium in which it survived and was transmitted best was a type of research culture based on career anxiety as the main ingredient. Once in the body, D. compulsivans— a so-called “memetic pseudovirus”—produced a single-stranded meme by hijacking the one-track mind of its human host. Passed to other members of a research group via close professional contact such as group meetings or departmental seminars, the pseudovirus would rapidly spread to whole institutes: the mechanism of transmission—via a so-called “memetic infectious particle”— was simple: the optical and auditory nerves were the point of entry through which the meme ultimately established itself in the limbic system or “paleomammalian cortex,” a part of the brain that facilitates emotion, behaviour, motivation, long-term memory and sense of smell. Importantly, the limbic system includes the amygdala, a small almond-shaped structure (from Greek amygdale = almond) considered to be the most ancient of the limbic components. Until relatively recently, the amygdala was thought to be involved primarily with generating instinctive reactions to fear or threat. However, it is now evident that it rather conveys cues from external emotionally relevant events that have been remembered to their “storage location” in the brain’s neural circuitry, so that they may be reactivated and produce a given behavioral response.[2] This is, in essence, a type of learned behavior, and it is triggered much faster than cognitive processes in the frontal cortexes: hence we do, indeed, react instinctively and rapidly to things that we perceive as dangerous or otherwise threatening, and sometimes wish we had “stopped to think” instead... Ah, that was it: “thinking.” That reminds me of where I was in the story. So, the long-term effect of D. compulsivans infection was an increase in learned behavior at the expense of thinking. The learned behavior was that associated with fear of “failing” in research, and it was encoded in the pseudoviral meme for productiveness. Productiveness was measured in the culture medium by quantity of publishable results, or “data,” and hence the emergent behavior in sufferers was an instinctive, unthinking (i.e., compulsive) drive to produce data. Evolutionarily, this secured the continuance of D. compulsivans, because the more that others saw and heard of infected fellow researchers producing data, the more they fell prey to the infection themselves. What happened next is quite extraordinary: a real virus, and not one to be messed with, basically shut down everyone’s labs and offices; millions of researchers had to stay at home. At first,</data>

      <data key="d2">Eduardo A. Groisman; Jeongjoon Choi</data>
      <data key="d3">Horizontal gene transfer advances bacterial evolution. To benefit from horizontally acquired genes, enteric bacteria must overcome silencing caused when the widespread heat‐stable nucleoid structuring (H‐NS) protein binds to AT‐rich horizontally acquired genes. This ability had previously been ascribed to both anti‐silencing proteins outcompeting H‐NS for binding to AT‐rich DNA and RNA polymerase initiating transcription from alternative promoters. However, we now know that pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and commensal Escherichia coli break down H‐NS when this silencer is not bound to DNA. Curiously, both species use the same protease – Lon – to destroy H‐NS in distinct environments. Anti‐silencing proteins promote the expression of horizontally acquired genes without binding to them by displacing H‐NS from AT‐rich DNA, thus leaving H‐NS susceptible to proteolysis and decreasing H‐NS amounts overall. Conserved amino acid sequences in the Lon protease and H‐NS cleavage site suggest that diverse bacteria degrade H‐NS to exploit horizontally acquired genes.</data>

A new criterion called cracking damage index (CDI) is used to predict the cracking susceptibility of the billets.

In this review, I will use specific examples to discuss how mutations in chromatin‐modifying factors might affect enhancer activity of disease‐relevant genes. I will then consider direct evidence from single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions, or deletions but also larger genomic rearrangements such as duplications, deletions, translocations, and inversions of specific enhancers to demonstrate how they have the ability to impact enhancer activity of disease genes including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Considering that the scientific community only fairly recently has begun to focus its attention on “enhancer malfunction” in disease, I propose that multiple new enhancer‐regulated and disease‐relevant processes will be uncovered in the near future that will constitute the mechanistic basis for novel therapeutic avenues.</data>

The core components of the destruction complex include Axin, APC, GSK3β, CK1α and other proteins. Recent studies demonstrated that Axin and APC undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), which is critical for their function to regulate Wnt/β‐catenin signaling.

The SMC proteins and cohesin complex primarily contribute to forming higher‐order chromatin structures, such as chromosomal territories, compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin loops anchored by CCCTC‐binding factor (CTCF) protein or other genome organizers. Cohesin plays a fundamental role in chromatin organization, gene expression and regulation. This review aims to describe the current understanding of the dynamic nature of the cohesin‐DNA complex and its dependence on cohesin for genome maintenance.

It is well known that there is a higher incidence of PVTs in cirrhosis with a higher MELD and Child Pugh score. The controversy for management of PVTs in cirrhotics lies in the individualized assessment of risks versus benefits of anticoagulation, since these patients have a complex hemostatic profile with both bleeding and procoagulant propensities.

      <data key="d3">Although the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is renowned for regulating a wide range of cellular processes and as an essential component of PML nuclear bodies (PML‐NBs), the mechanisms through which it exerts its broad physiological impact are far from fully elucidated. Here, we review recent studies supporting an emerging view that PML's pleiotropic effects derive, at least partially, from its role in regulating histone H3.3 chromatin assembly, a critical epigenetic mechanism. These studies suggest that PML maintains heterochromatin organization by restraining H3.3 incorporation. Examination of PML's contribution to H3.3 chromatin assembly in the context of the cell cycle and PML‐NB assembly suggests that PML represses heterochromatic H3.3 deposition during S phase and that transcription and SUMOylation regulate PML's recruitment to heterochromatin. Elucidating PML’ s contributions to H3.3‐mediated epigenetic regulation will provide insight into PML's expansive influence on cellular physiology and open new avenues for studying oncogenesis linked to PML malfunction.</data>

The proposed mechanism of AZA and DAC relies on active DNA replication and therefore patient responses are only observed after multiple cycles of treatment. Although extended dosing may provide the optimal scheduling, the reliance of injectable formulation of the drug limits it to intermittent treatment. Recently, an oral formulation of AZA demonstrated significantly improved patient relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) when used as maintenance after chemotherapy for AML. In addition, both DAC and AZA were found to be highly effective to improve survival in elderly patients with AML through combination with other drugs. These recent exciting results have changed the therapeutic paradigm for elderly patients with AML. In light of this, we review current knowledge on HMA mechanism of action, clinical trials exploring dosing and scheduling, and recent HMA combination therapies to enhance efficacy.</data>

      <data key="d3">Polyploid cells contain multiple copies of all chromosomes. Polyploidization can be developmentally programmed to sustain tissue barrier function or to increase metabolic potential and cell size. Programmed polyploidy is normally associated with terminal differentiation and poor proliferation capacity. Conversely, non‐programmed polyploidy can give rise to cells that retain the ability to proliferate. This can fuel rapid genome rearrangements and lead to diseases like cancer. Here, the mechanisms that generate polyploidy are reviewed and the possible challenges upon polyploid cell division are discussed. The discussion is framed around a recent study showing that asynchronous cell cycle progression (an event that is named “chronocrisis”) of different nuclei from a polyploid cell can generate DNA damage at mitotic entry. The potential mechanisms explaining how mitosis in non‐programmed polyploid cells can generate abnormal karyotypes and genetic instability are highlighted.</data>

      <data key="d3">The biogenesis of RNAs and proteins is a threat to the cell. Indeed, the act of transcription and nascent RNAs challenge DNA stability. Both RNAs and nascent proteins can also initiate the formation of toxic aggregates because of their physicochemical properties. In reviewing the literature, I show that co‐transcriptional and co‐translational biophysical constraints can trigger DNA instability that in turn increases the likelihood that sequences that alleviate the constraints emerge over evolutionary time. These directed genetic variations rely on the biogenesis of small RNAs that are transcribed directly from challenged DNA regions or processed from the transcripts that directly or indirectly generate constraints or aggregates. These small RNAs can then target the genomic regions from which they initially originate and increase the local mutation rate of the targeted loci. This mechanism is based on molecular pathways involved in anti‐parasite genome defence systems, and implies that gene expression‐related biophysical constraints represent a driving force of genome evolution.</data>

      <data key="d1">2021</data>
      <data key="d2">Jean‐Pascal Capp; Frédéric Thomas</data>
      <data key="d3">Sir, We read the recent correspondence by Mesut Tez[1] arguing that our proposal that tissue-disruption-induced cellular stochasticity (TiDiS) is at the origin of both aging and cancer[2] should be considered as a hypothesis and not as a theory. We argued that disruption of the tissue equilibrium, and the subsequent increase in cellular stochasticity, might be the initiator event in both processes. We agree that the TiDiS concept is a bold attempt to reconsider the respective role of the tissue equilibrium, epigenetic drift and genetic alterations, and as such can be considered as a hypothesis because it opens radically new research perspectives that have not been formally experimentally tested yet. However, we think that the TiDiS concept is already more than a hypothesis at this stage and offers a new coherent framework that allows the reinterpretation and integration of many experimental findings in both fields. Moreover, we formulated our proposal in line with works arguing that the reduction of gene expression variability and the acquisition of epigenetic and phenotypic stability through direct or long-range cellular interactions during cell differentiation can serveas a solid ground forbuilding anewtheoretical framework inboth developmental and cancer biology. In particular, we previously offered new perspectives on oncogenesis,[3] taking multiple myeloma as a paradigmatic example,[4] cancer stem cells[5] and stem cell biology,[6] all of which are based on the same foundation—that is, the central role of stochastic gene expression. This collection of works, well supported by experimental facts and written in the same perspective, can hopefully accord the TiDiS concept the status of a theory. As such, it allows us to interpret and rethink observations that were previously interpreted differently in other theoretical frameworks, representing, in addition, the basis for formulating new hypotheses on the behaviour of biological systems. Dr. Tez also questioned the relevance of the TiDiS concept in explaining paediatric cancers. This is an interesting comment, because indeed intuition would a priori suggest that the scenario we proposed should mostly concern cancers that occur in the second part of the life. First, we would like to recall that although dramatic and increasingly frequent, cancers in children remain relatively rare compared with cancers in adults. Then, our response to Dr. Tez’ comment will be two-fold. It is generally admitted that the aetiology of paediatric cancers, even if far from being totally elucidated, is different from that of adult cancers. We cannot exclude the possibility that the TiDiS concept could be another illustration of the differential processes involved in the initiation of cancers in adults and children. That being said, it is still interesting to examine deeper the extent to which the TiDiS concept could, at least partly, be relevant in explaining paediatric cancers as well. Notably, tissue disruption could also be involved in the early steps of these cancers, not linked to the aging, but because the tissue equilibrium is more precarious in childhood (growing and remodelling tissues and organs). They would therefore be more sensitive to disruption and more at risk, especially if genetic abnormalities pre-exist. Tissue disruption in children would necessarily have a different origin than inflammaging, for example, and exogenous (environmental) factors could be more explicitly involved. As rightly noted by Dr. Tez, paediatric cancers almost always concern blood, brain and bones. An interesting route of enquiry would thus be to explore whether the microenvironmental conditions present in these specific compartments of the body are particularly compatible with the TiDiS concept, irrespectively of the individual’s age.Wehavenodefinitive answer to this point, even if, interestingly, it has been proposed that these three compartments are among those that have undergonemost change in the recent human evolutionary history, and as such would miss canalisation— that is, one might expect them to yield to more frequent cell derailments for insufficient natural defences against cancerous development (i.e., a mismatch between cancer risks and cancer defence).[7] If the density of the cell–cell interaction network is a major contributor among the cancer-suppressive mechanisms, as we previously suggested,[8] a lower connectivity in these compartments, especially during organ growth, would hypothetically explain their higher vulnerability tomalignant development in childhood.</data>

The authors describe here the essential structural features of the cohesin complex in connection to its ability to associate DNA molecules and review the current knowledge on the architectural‐functional organization of the eukaryotic replisome, significantly advanced by recent biochemical and structural studies.

We aimed to investigate and compare the effects of four types of pectins on dietary fiber (DF) fermentation, microbiota composition, and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production throughout the large intestine in rats.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Male Wistar rats were given diets supplemented with or without 3% structurally different pectins for 7 weeks. Different fermentation patterns of pectins and different location of fermentation of pectin and diet arabinoxylans (AXs) in the large intestine were observed. During cecal fermentation, sugar beet pectin significantly stimulated Lactobacillus (p &lt; 0.01) and Lachnospiraceae (p &lt; 0.05). The stimulating effects of sugar beet pectin on these two groups of microbes are stronger than both other pectins. In the cecum, low-methyl esterified citrus pectin and complex soy pectin increased (p &lt; 0.05) the production of total SCFAs, propionate and butyrate, whereas high-methyl esterified pectin and sugar beet pectin did not. The fermentation patterns of cereal AXs in the cecum were significantly different upon supplementation of different pectins. These differences, however, became smaller in the colon due to an enhanced fermentation of the remaining DFs.


CONCLUSION
Dietary supplementation of pectin is a potential strategy to modulate the location of fermentation of DFs, and consequently microbiota composition and SCFA production for health-promoting effects.</data>

      <data key="d3">The evolutionary origin of synapses and neurons is an enigmatic subject that inspires much debate. Non‐bilaterian metazoans, both with and without neurons and their closest relatives already contain many components of the molecular toolkits for synapse functions. The origin of these components and their assembly into ancient synaptic signaling machineries are particularly important in light of recent findings on the phylogeny of non‐bilaterian metazoans. The evolution of synapses and neurons are often discussed only from a metazoan perspective leaving a considerable gap in our understanding. By taking an integrative approach we highlight the need to consider different, but extremely relevant phyla and to include the closest unicellular relatives of metazoans, the ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates, to fully understand the evolutionary origin of synapses and neurons. This approach allows for a detailed understanding of when and how the first pre‐ and postsynaptic signaling machineries evolved.</data>

      <data key="d3">Some patients with perioral dermatitis are not relieved despite many medications. These patients confront pain, psychological bother and social/occupational limitations. Being efficient for a wide variety of diseases including infectious inflammative degenerative or tumoral, photodynamic therapy holds a good chance to cure diseases of unknown origin, such as perioral dermatitis. This study presents the results of three women with chronic perioral dermatitis that persisted for years with partial response to medical regimen. They asked for photodynamic treatment to ease off their suffering. The duration of follow-up was up to five years. Following PDT (photodynamic therapy), the patients discontinued medications, redness decreased and eruption disappeared. In these patients, a single PDT treatment provided prolonged relief of perioral dermatitis for up to three years. These data are encouraging but not sufficient. Further study is warranted.</data>

A brightening complex consisting of niacin, Rumex spp. and biomimetic peptide is supposed to be an efficient alternative for commonly used brightening agents. In-vivo research of night cream (1474) was conducted in order to confirm the safety and efficiency of tri-active brightening cream in treatment of facial skin hyperpigmentation. The research was conducted on a group of 30 female patients, and the night cream was applied once a day for six weeks. The research was done by the use of VISIA system, multifunctional MPA and PRIMOS projection system, which was applied with VISIOSCAN camera. Besides, the research also included a questionnaire. A decrease in melanin by 16% and 25% at 93% and 96% of patients, respectively, was observed after three and six weeks of regular application of the cream. Furthermore, we also noticed reduction of erythema which was accompanied by an increase in the skin moisture. Brightening of changes on hyperpigmented facial skin proved to be efficient after an application of tri-active complex which was a component of the night cream.</data>

An explanation of reflective functioning, related research, and its relevance to relational treatment and preventive intervention are discussed. Other approaches to reflective practice are referenced. We describe the necessary tension and encounters with distressing affect that mark reflective supervision groups using this focus. In addition, we identify areas of heightened difficulty in infant family work and describe how a group supervision process that enables use of self alongside perspectives of others may address these challenges while leading to increased reflective capacity among participants. Finally, we touch on relevant research on group supervision and parameters of size and focus, and highlight facilitation skills needed to create group safety and coherence.

      <data key="d3">On May 4, 2016, geoarchaeology lost one of its greatest proponents and founders. Karl Butzer left a vast and stimulating legacy for younger generations of geographers, archaeologists, Quaternary geologists, and other scholars. A prolific writer, Karl left dozens of articles, chapters, and books, some of which have become in large part the basis for our current understanding of the evolution of humans and their environment. As a teacher and advisor he forged several generation of scholars and researchers, and as a true scholar, he influenced many individual scholars and schools of thought around the world. Karl Butzer was born in Germany on August 19, 1934. At the age of four he emigrated with his family to England (landing in Southampton) and then to Canada, where he grew up. He received a B.Sc. (honors) degree in Mathematics (1954) and a Master’s degree in Meteorology and Geography (1955) from McGill University in Montreal. He went back to his native Germany where he got his doctor in science degree (Dr. rer. Nat.) in Physical Geography and Ancient History (1957) at Bonn University, where he worked under the supervision of the renowned geographer and climatologist, Karl Troll. He remained in Germany for two years as a research member of the German Academy of Sciences and Literature. His first academic appointment in the United States was with the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1959–1966), then with the University of Chicago (1966–1981 and 1982– 1984). During a year (1981–1982) he was a chaired professor at the Swiss Institute of Science and Technology (ETH) in Zurich. In 1984 he moved to the University of Texas at Austin as a Dickson Centennial Professor of Liberal Arts and a faculty member at the Department of Geography and the Environment until his death.</data>

Vero cell line maintained in DMEM (Dubecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) and incubated with Trypanosoma evansi for more than 12 h. MPE was added to the Vero cell culture medium at different concentrations (250~1,000 μg/mL) with trypanosomes concentration (1 × 10 trypanosomes/mL in each ELISA plate well) and incubated at appropriate conditions for 72 h. In-vitro cytotoxicity of MPE of E. officinalis was determined on Vero cells at concentrations ((1.56~100 μg/mL). Acute toxicity and in-vivo infectivity tests were done in mice. Obtained MPE of E. officinalis underwent process of purification via column chromatography, preparative chromatography and HPLC (higher performance liquid chromatography) with bioassay at different strata on Alsever’s medium. In-vivo assay for trypanocidal activity, MPE and PPFs (partially purified fractions) of E. officinalis with two sets of mice, each mouse was inoculated with 1 × 10/mL of trypanosomes and treated (48 h post inoculation) at concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) were administered at dose rate of 100 μL per mouse via intraperitoneal route (in treating parassitemic mice) to different groups of mice, 6 mice per concentration. HPLC of partially purified fractions of E. officinalis was carried out with mobile phase of acetonitrile: water (40:60) in gradient mode. In vitro, MPE induced immobilization and killing of the parasites in concentration-time dependent manner. Significant reduction of trypanosomes counts from concentration of 250 μg/mL and complete killing of trypanosomes at 5th hour of observation, which was statistically equivalent to 4th hour of Diminazine Aceturate (Berenil), standard reference drug used. HPLC of the partially purified fractions revealed two major prominent peaks at retention time of 1~4 min. In vivo, both MPE and PPFs of test material did prolong lives of mice by 6~9 days but could not cure them. At concentration of 2,000 kg/kg body weight of MPE in acute test, all mice survived. For in-vivo infectivity test, mice injected with immobilized trypanosomes developed parasitemia and died while, the other group survived. MPE, PPFs and Diminazine Aceturate were toxic to Vero cells at all concentrations exception of 1.56, 1.56~3.13 and 1.56~6.25 μg/mL, respectively. From this report, PPFs of E. officinalis dried fruits demonstrated potential pathway for a new development of trypanocide in near future if additional investigations are put in place.</data>

It also suggests that the playwright’s processes,such as monologue writing, can be seen as a form of pedagogical practice and building onthat, a form of public pedagogy.The practice-led research drawn on in this article involves students participating in the process ofmonologue writing workshops conducted in two settings: in a secondary school with a group ofdrama students (nine students and two teachers), and in a university teacher-training setting (23pre-service teachers). In the first setting the process was used to explore issues of social labelling,and in the second setting, the pre-service teachers were asked to consider the point of view of students from whom they felt a sense of disconnection.

      <data key="d3">Venlafaxine, an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) drug, is commonly used to treat depression. Although it is very rare, venlafaxine may lead to addiction or abuse in some patients. To date, there are very limited data available on venlafaxine addiction. The aim of this article is to draw an attention to dependence of venlafaxine in clinical practice. Significant point of this article is: Our patient was addicted by “high” doses of venlafaxine for getting high effects. Overdose of venlafaxine produces an amphethamine-like “high” with experiences of euphoria by its ability to increase neurotransmitter levels in addiction literature [1-3]. We present a man aged 42 years, who was referred to our clinic for detoxification from venlafaxine addiction. He had been taking venlafaxine upto 1,950~2,100 mg/day to get high for the past 10 years. Physicians must be careful when prescribing antidepressants to patients, especially those with a history of alcohol and/or drug addictions or abuse.</data>

      <data key="d3">An ADS (automated dispensing system) was implemented in our hospital pharmacy in 2008 to optimize and secure the medication process. The main objective of this study was to compare the projected and the real ROI (return on investment), after seven years of use. ROI was calculated annually (from 2008 to 2015), by deducting the cost of investment (ADS buying and implementation, maintenance, repairs and ADS upgrade) from the cost saving (drugs stock reduction and decrease of pharmacy staff dedicated to global dispensing). In 2015, total costs saving (+$1,141,987) were divided between decreasing drug stock value and reduction of pharmacy staff. Total costs of investment (−$978,656) were acquisition, maintenance, repairs and an unplanned upgrade costs. Finally, the real ROI was +$163,331 after seven years of use. In 2008, projected ROI was +$410,786. The real payback period has been increased by approximately two years (six years of use, instead of four years as expected). Despite their cost, ADSs are a worthwhile investment, leading to a ROI within a few years. These economic considerations should be put into perspective with optimization of drugs stock management, greater efficiency of the global dispensing process, securitization of medication process and redeployment of pharmacy staff.</data>

      <data key="d3">The aim of our study was to determine the criteria and key factors for the effectiveness of digoxin therapy. A prospective opened-type study was carried out in conditions of everyday clinical practice. The concentrations of digoxin were quantified from blood samples taken following the achievement of drug steady-state (using AxSYM microparticle enzyme immunoassay-MEIA). The risk/benefit ratio was evaluated based upon the correlation between measured blood concentrations of the drug and clinical response. Study results (100 decompensated patients) revealed that therapy indication field was correctly covered, showing a higher prevalence in elderly. On average, each examinee had 2 or 3 comorbidities. Applied daily dose of digoxin ranged from 0.053 mg to 0.25 mg. Renal function was assessed by creatinine clearance which is one of the key factors for the accomplishment of optimal digoxin serum concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). Co-administration of seven drugs was complicating factor for the management of rational therapy. 76/100 patients were within referent range (0.8-2.0 ng/mL), while 13/100 were above the upper limit. Four side effects in total were recorded (nausea, vomiting, confusion), whereas in only two patients digoxin was excluded from the therapy. Digoxin confirmed the justifiability of its use in contemporary clinical practice.</data>

RenaGel® has been an example with remarkable success of a polymer synthesized to prevent the absorption of dietary phosphate for ESRD patients. Electrostatic interaction is the primary driving force for complexation of phosphate-based anions with these amino groups in the polymer backbone. Chitosan is a deacetylation product of chitin, which is the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans and cell walls of fungi. The amino groups in the backbone give the phosphate binding ability to chitosan. This article has demonstrated that chitosan exhibited a phosphate binding effect indeed. Thus, it has potential applications in environmental management and wastewater treatment, as well as treatment of hyperphosphatemia patients.</data>

There were made inquiries by the way of filling applications, which (the applications) were given to the managers of Aversi, PSP, GPC, Pharmadepot and Pharmaceutical House. 50 managers were interviewed totally. It was established that pharmaceutical company management appoints people on the position of pharmacist-managers mainly on the basis of contract (90%). At present, the pharmacist education does not comply with the competence, so 55% of interviewed managers are bachelors, 45% are masters. In order to increase the management’s qualifications, pharmaceutical companies are conducting seminars (50%), trainings (30%), and testing (20%). Staff administration in the pharmacies is mainly carried out by the company administration (75%), rarely by managers (25%), but very often the administration takes into consideration the manager’s opinion; employees are accepted by testing-interview (70%) or CV (30%). Professional career and experience of the newly employed staff are not highly important (50/50), and the company prefers to educate and share practice to the personnel itself. It is possible to conclude that today the pharmacist-managers of the pharmacies are working in accordance with the contractual rights and obligations signed with the employers and pharmaceutical activities regulated under non-governmental institutes. As a result, it is important to be included special features of pharmaceutical management and the recommendations offered by the World Health Organization and the International Pharmaceutical Federation in the articles of regulatory laws.</data>

The objective of the current investigation was to look closely at the practice of patients and cares in Nablus-Palestine with regard to disposal of unused or expired medicines. The study was a cross-sectional survey administered via face-to-face structured interviews with randomly selected patients, community pharmacists and physicians from Nablus-Palestine. Two hundred and fifty patients/cares completed a questionnaire regarding medicines disposal current practice, effects on environment, and their views to overcome this problem. Most of the people completing the questionnaire (67%) stated that they throw unwanted medicines in the normal household bins, and about 75% think that this can impose illegal and environmental hazards. Nearly half of the questionnaire showed that main reason for need to dispose medicines was possessing expired ones with almost believe there should be more appropriate way to dispose medicines. About 95% said they have not been directed for safe disposal of medicines with 46% thinking that a national campaign can be very educative in this issue mainly through Ministry of Health (54%) followed by .73% of the sampled patients were in favor of national campaign to direct people to safe disposal of medicines. This pilot study in Nablus clearly highlights the need for appropriate method for safe disposal of medicines in Palestine through guidelines in pharmacies and hospitals. A well organized method for collecting unwanted medicines from people should be encouraged through appropriate teaching of patients and carers about effects of waste medicines on environment as well as being domestic hazard. The data and information is valuable for furthering discussions regarding patients behaviour and also provides a basis for future research into determining what quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are disposed, enter the environment and what effects it can impose.</data>

Endotracheal intubation is the basic reanimation procedure performed both in hospital and out-of-hospital settings. It is carried out whenever chest movements and spontaneous respiration are compromised. Respiratory arrest may occur for a variety of reasons (such as cardac arrest, coma of any origin, poisining) or direct damage to the airways, e.g. in various traumas (damages to the face, oropharynx, larynx, trachea, chest). The basic endotracheal intubation kit contains: laryngoscope, endotracheal tubes, connectors (tube and Ambu bag connectors), complete Ambu kit (face mask and bag), 20 mL syringe for cuff inflating, suction apparatus, stylete, and Magill forceps. In order to assess the successfulness of endotracheal intubation, it is necessary first to identify patients who need to be intubated. With the aim of identifying such patients, numerous screening tests and scales have been created to predict difficult intubation. The best known and most commonly used are the Mallampati and Wilson classifications as well as the LEMON airway assessment method. Nevertheless, difficult intubation accounts for 1% of cases. It usually occurs when manipulation of the laryngoscope blade is not possible in obese patients and patients with short neck, in congenital restricted mouth opening, limited neck movement as well as limited temporomandibular joint mobility; in cases of edema, fibrosis and lesions of the tongue, pharynx and larynx; when there are anatomical variations and congenital malformations of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, head, neck and chest.</data>

The secondary objective of this study is to assess LOS (length of stay), in days, before and after protocol implementation. A retrospective chart review was conducted from October 2015 through March 2016 for all laparoscopic colorectal surgeries. Number of post-operative alvimopan doses received and LOS was recorded for each patient that received at least one dose of alvimopan. Comparative data, before protocol implementation, from November 2014 through June 2015 were analyzed against the study data. Number of post-operative alvimopan doses and LOS were recorded. The mean number of doses was 6.41 in the comparator group and 4.25 in the study group (probability size P &lt; 0.001), which did meet statistical significance. Although the secondary objective was not statistically significant, LOS slightly decreased as the mean LOS was 5.01 days in the comparator group versus 4.49 days in the study group (P = 0.256). At the current price of $120 per capsule, close to $30,000 was saved during the study period, projecting an annual cost savings of approximately $68,000. Results from this study show that pharmacists can play a vital role in cost savings and ensuring appropriate use of certain high-risk medications, like alvimopan, without increasing overall length of stay.</data>

Neurotoxicity is a key feature of different types of envenomations and there are many unanswered questions regarding this manifestation. Acute neuromuscular weakness with respiratory involvement is the most clinically important neurotoxic effect. We present how the neuroparalytic poison affects the human body and what actually happens when the poison is injected into the human body. Neuroparalytic poisons are one of the most lethal, because they cause paralysis of the eye, throat and chest muscles. A well-known member of the Elapidae family is the cobra. Bungarotoxins are a group of closely related neurotoxin proteins. The -bungarotoxin inhibits the binding of acetylcholine (ACh) to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; -bungarotoxin and -bungarotoxins act presynaptically causing excessive acetylcholine release and subsequent depletion.</data>

      <data key="d3">The article discusses the risk for the origin of vaccine-preventable diseases in HIV (+) people and the possibilities for their prevention. HIV (+) people are with 4-8 times greater risk to be infected with influenza and 1.5 times higher to die. They belong to a risk group of 35-100 times possibility to acquire invasive pneumococcal disease in comparison with non-infected people. The risk for origin of invasive meningococcal disease for them is 5-13 times greater. There is significantly higher risk for HIV (+) persons to be infected with pertussis, hepatitis A, В and С and also human papilloma virus infection. That is why the HIV-infected have to be immunized with the vaccines for which they have not contraindications. Inactivated, polysaccharide, recombinant vaccines and toxoids may be administered to HIV (+) patients: inactivated poliomyelitis; against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (inactivated whole cell or acellular); only diphtheria and tetanus; tetanus toxoid; polysaccharide against typhoid fever; haemophilus influenza type B; hepatitis A and B; influenza; meningococcal and pneumococcal infections. Passive immune prophylaxis may also be applied to HIV (+): with human normal immune globulin—after contact with infected people from hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, meningococcal infection; or with specific hepatitis B immune globulin, immune globulin against rabies and immune globulin for varicella-zoster virus. Live vaccines have not to be applied to HIV-infected: BCG, MMR, OPV, Vivotif, rotavirus, varicella and yellow fever. In conclusion, as soon as possible after the diagnosis of HIV infection is confirmed, we have to check the immune status of this person for the routine immunizations. The necessary immunizations have to be done if they lack. And then it is appropriate to do the recommended vaccines.</data>

Faktor penyebab kegagalan usaha perusahaan pada prinsipnya dibedakan menjadi 2 faktor, yaitu factor internal dan eksternal (Bambang Riyanto,1995). Selain itu, jika dilihat dari analisis kebangkrutan maka factor penyebab kebangkrutan diantaranya adalah: pendapatan yang tidak terpenuhi, biaya yang tinggi sehingga target laba tidak tercapai, tingkat liabilitas tinggi sehingga menjadi beban perusahaan serta asset yang belum optimal dalam mendukung perolehan pendapatan perusahaan. Agar perusahaan dapat menghindarkan diri dari zona kebangkrutan dan juga potensi bencana yang akan muncul maka perusahaan harus melakukan mitigasi pada factor-faktor penyebab kebangkrutan.

      <data key="d3">Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of a 27-gauge (G) 20,000 cuts per minute (cpm) vitreous cutter in clinical settings. Patients and Methods This was a retrospective and observational study of 40 eyes of 40 patients with idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM). Twenty patients (20 eyes) were treated using a 27G 10,000-cpm vitreous cutter (Advanced ULTRAVIT® Probe, Alcon), whereas the remaining 20 patients (20 eyes) were treated using a 27G 20,000-cpm cutter (Hypervit® dual-blade probe, Alcon). All the surgeries were performed by the same surgeon (YM). The time from the start of vitrectomy to the start of ERM peeling was independently measured by two separate examiners using digital videos of each surgery. The average duration of vitrectomy was calculated for each patient. Additionally, the data of the patients in the two groups were extracted from their medical and surgical records and compared. Results The time from the initiation of vitrectomy until the start of ERM peeling was 184 ± 56.9 and 152 ± 39.5 s for the 10,000-cpm and 20,000-cpm groups, respectively. The duration of vitrectomy was significantly shorter in the 20,000-cpm group than in the 10,000-cpm group (p = 0.041). Postoperative vitreous hemorrhage was observed in one patient in the 10,000-cpm group, whereas no complications were observed in the 20,000-cpm group. Conclusion In a clinical setting, the 27G 20,000-cpm vitreous cutter may have a higher safety profile and higher efficacy for vitreous removal than that of the 27G 10,000-cpm vitreous cutter.</data>

      <data key="d3">Recent developments of sequencing technologies that allow the production of massive amounts of genomic and genotyping data have highlighted the need for synthetic data representation and pattern recognition methods that can mine and help discovering biologically meaningful knowledge included in such large data sets. Correspondence analysis (CA) is an exploratory descriptive method designed to analyze two-way data tables, including some measure of association between rows and columns. It constructs linear combinations of variables, known as factors. CA has been used for decades to study high-dimensional data, and remarkable inferences from large data tables were obtained by reducing the dimensionality to a few orthogonal factors that correspond to the largest amount of variability in the data. Herein, I review CA and highlight its use by considering examples in handling high-dimensional data that can be constructed from genomic and genetic studies. Examples in amino acid compositions of large sets of species (viruses, phages, yeast, and fungi) as well as an example related to pairwise shared orthologs in a set of yeast and fungal species, as obtained from their proteome comparisons, are considered. For the first time, results show striking segregations between yeasts and fungi as well as between viruses and phages. Distributions obtained from shared orthologs show clusters of yeast and fungal species corresponding to their phylogenetic relationships. A direct comparison with the principal component analysis method is discussed using a recently published example of genotyping data related to newly discovered traces of an ancient hominid that was compared to modern human populations in the search for ancestral similarities. CA offers more detailed results highlighting links between modern humans and the ancient hominid and their characterizations. Compared to the popular principal component analysis method, CA allows easier and more effective interpretation of results, particularly by the ability of relating individual patterns with their corresponding characteristic variables.</data>

      <data key="d3">The human intestinal microbiome is a microbial ecosystem that expresses as many as 100 times more genes than the human host, thereby constituting an important component of the human holobiome, which contributes to multiple health and disease processes. As most commensal species are difficult or impossible to culture, genomic characterization of microbiome composition and function, under various environmental conditions, comprises a central tool in understanding its roles in health and disease. The first decade of microbiome research was mainly characterized by usage of DNA sequencing-based 16S rDNA and shotgun metagenome sequencing, allowing for the elucidation of microbial composition and genome structure. Technological advances in RNA-seq have recently provided us with an ability to gain insight into the genes that are actively expressed in complex bacterial communities, enabling the elucidation of the functional changes that dictate the microbiome functions at given contexts, its interactions with the host, and functional alterations that accompany the conversion of a healthy microbiome toward a disease-driving configuration. Here, we highlight some of the key metatranscriptomics strategies that are implemented to determine microbiota gene expression and its regulation and discuss the advantages and potential challenges associated with these approaches.</data>

      <data key="d2">Carol L. Ecale Zhou</data>
      <data key="d3">Modeling the molecular mechanisms that govern genetic variation can be useful in understanding the dynamics that drive genetic state transition in quasispecies viruses. For example, there is considerable interest in understanding how the relatively benign vaccine strains of poliovirus eventually revert to forms that confer neurovirulence and cause disease (ie, vaccine-derived poliovirus). This report describes a stochastic simulation model, S2M, which can be used to generate hypothetical outcomes based on known mechanisms of genetic diversity. S2M begins with predefined genotypes based on the Sabin-1 and Mahoney wild-type sequences, constructs a set of independent cell-based populations, and performs in-cell replication and cell-to-cell infection cycles while quantifying genetic changes that track the transition from Sabin-1 toward Mahoney. Realism is incorporated into the model by assigning defaults for variables that constrain mechanisms of genetic variability based roughly on metrics reported in the literature, yet these values can be modified at the command line in order to generate hypothetical outcomes driven by these parameters. To demonstrate the utility of S2M, simulations were performed to examine the effects of the rates of replication error and recombination and the presence or absence of defective interfering particles, upon reaching the end states of Mahoney resemblance (semblance of a vaccine-derived state), neurovirulence, genome fitness, and cloud diversity. Simulations provide insight into how modeled biological features may drive hypothetical outcomes, independently or in combination, in ways that are not always intuitively obvious.</data>

      <data key="d3">Telomere length dynamics plays a crucial role in regulation of cellular processes and cell fate. In contrast to epidemiological studies revealing the association of telomere length with age, age-related diseases, and cancers, the role of telomeres in regulation of transcriptome and epigenome and the role of genomic variations in telomere lengthening are not extensively analyzed. This is explained by the fact that experimental assays for telomere length measurement are resource consuming, and there are very few studies where high-throughput genomics, transcriptomics, and/or epigenomics experiments have been coupled with telomere length measurements. Recent development of computational approaches for assessment of telomere length from whole genome sequencing data pave a new perspective on integration of telomeres into high-throughput systems biology analysis framework. Herein, we review existing methodologies for telomere length measurement and compare them to computational approaches, as well as discuss their applications in large-scale studies on telomere length dynamics.</data>

      <data key="d3">Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are low-affinity, high-capacity transporters that rapidly transport calcium against a gradient of Na+ ions. Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are divided into three groups based upon substrate specificity: Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX), Na+/Ca2+/K+ exchangers (NCKX), and Ca2+/cation exchangers (NCLX). In mammals, there are three NCX genes, five NCKX genes, and a single NCLX gene. The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains 10 Na+/Ca2+ exchanger genes: three NCX, five NCLX, and two NCKX genes. In a previous study, we characterized the structural and taxonomic specializations within the family of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers across the phylum Nematoda and observed a complex picture of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger evolution across diverse nematode species. We noted multiple cases of putative gene gain and loss and, most surprisingly, did not detect members of the NCLX type of exchangers within subsets of nematode species. In this commentary, we discuss these findings and speculate on the functional outcomes and physiology of these observations. Our data highlight the importance of studying diverse systems in order to get a deeper understanding of the evolution and regulation of Ca2+ signaling critical for animal function.</data>

      <data key="d3">While it has long been thought that all genomic novelties are derived from the existing material, many genes lacking homology to known genes were found in recent genome projects. Some of these novel genes were proposed to have evolved de novo, ie, out of noncoding sequences, whereas some have been shown to follow a duplication and divergence process. Their discovery called for an extension of the historical hypotheses about gene origination. Besides the theoretical breakthrough, increasing evidence accumulated that novel genes play important roles in evolutionary processes, including adaptation and speciation events. Different techniques are available to identify genes and classify them as novel. Their classification as novel is usually based on their similarity to known genes, or lack thereof, detected by comparative genomics or against databases. Computational approaches are further prime methods that can be based on existing models or leveraging biological evidences from experiments. Identification of novel genes remains however a challenging task. With the constant software and technologies updates, no gold standard, and no available benchmark, evaluation and characterization of genomic novelty is a vibrant field. In this review, the classical and state-of-the-art tools for gene prediction are introduced. The current methods for novel gene detection are presented; the methodological strategies and their limits are discussed along with perspective approaches for further studies.</data>

      <data key="d3">We propose a new application of molecular shape descriptors in hierarchical selection during virtual screening (VS). Here, a structure-based pharmacophore and docking-guided VS protocol have been evolved to identify inhibitors against adenosine kinase (AK). The knowledge gained on the shape requirements has been extrapolated in classifying active and inactive molecules against this target. This classification enabled us to pick the appropriate ligand conformation in the binding site. We have suggested a set of hierarchical filters for VS, from a simple molecular shape analysis (MSA) descriptor-based recursive models to docking scores. This approach permits a systematic study to understand the importance of spatial requirements and limitations for inhibitors against AK. Finally, the guidelines on how to select compounds for AK to achieve success have been highlighted. The utility of this approach has been suggested by giving an example of database screening for plausible active compounds.</data>

The identification of immune checkpoints such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 has led to the development of an array of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). These immunologic approaches against tumoral cells come with a novel kind of side effects that the clinician needs to be familiarized with. Herein, we report for the first time a case of organizing pneumonia, based on imaging and cytological analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage, possibly associated with the use of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 Mab recently approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.</data>

      <data key="d3">Carbon based light emitters ranging from small organic molecules to carbon nanotubes have been subject of a great attention in the framework of diverse applications such as optoelectronics, bio-imaging, and quantum technologies. In this context, graphene quantum dots (GQD) whose size is between that of small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and of carbon nanotubes, have important assets. In particular the complete control of the structure allowed by their synthesis through bottom-up chemistry opens the way to a wide customization of their electronic, optical, and spin properties [1-3].
 The full benefit from these opportunities requires addressing GQD’s intrinsic photophysical properties. To do so, single molecule photoluminescence experiment is a powerful tool [4-6]. Nevertheless, until now, GQDs faced a problem of solubility that has complexified both the study of their intrinsic properties and their use for applications. In this presentation, we will report on the study of new structures that show a quasi-perfect solubility. We will show how this breakthrough allows us studying in depth their photophysics. Finally, we will see that the theoretical predictions of the evolution of the electronic properties of the GQDs with their structure are fully confirmed by the experiments.

      <data key="d3">Malaria is one of the deadly diseases, which affects a large number of the world's population. The Plasmodium falciparum parasite during erythrocyte stages produces its energy mainly through anaerobic glycolysis, with pyruvate being converted into lactate. The glycolysis metabolism in P. falciparum is one of the important metabolic pathways of the parasite because the parasite is entirely dependent on it for energy. Also, several glycolytic enzymes have been proposed as drug targets. Petri nets (PNs) have been recognized as one of the important models for representing biological pathways. In this work, we built a qualitative PN model for the glycolysis pathway in P. falciparum and analyzed the model for its structural and quantitative properties using PN theory. From PlasmoCyc files, a total of 11 reactions were extracted; 6 of these were reversible and 5 were irreversible. These reactions were catalyzed by a total number of 13 enzymes. We extracted some of the essential reactions in the pathway using PN model, which are the possible drug targets without which the pathway cannot function. This model also helps to improve the understanding of the biological processes within this pathway.</data>

      <data key="d3">There is no fully effective treatment for secondary lymphedema. In patients with breast cancer, lymphedema may present immediately after axillary dissection or years later. It typically occurs in a limb (such as an arm), but it can also occur in the torso, especially in breast cancer patients. It is, therefore, essential to prevent or minimize the condition. The currently used compression therapy has varying efficiency. Thus, researchers are still looking for better solutions, especially for primary prevention. The aim of this study was to find whether compression corsets therapy with a class I compression garment could prevent truncal lymphedema on the operated side in females who underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection as the standard of care for breast cancer treatment without subsequent reconstruction. We also investigated whether this therapy is efficient in prevention and treatment of truncal lymphedema in patients who underwent mastectomy and additional radiotherapy, and finally whether this method could be implemented for pain reduction strategies in this treatment group. The study was carried out in 50 randomly selected breast cancer patients classified by the oncologist as candidates for surgery. The final study was completed in 37 patients who underwent mastectomy and lymphadenectomy. The study group was randomly divided into two subgroups: subgroup G (received compression corsets 1 month following the surgery) and subgroup K (control) in which the patients underwent no physiotherapeutic treatment. The size of truncal lymphedema was measured using ultrasound in presentation B. Measurements were carried out symmetrically on both sides of the chest wall. The patients were examined four times. The follow-up was for 7 months in total. After the second measurement, a randomly selected subgroup of patients received properly fitted compression corsets, which they had to wear throughout the study, whereas the control subgroup had no physiotherapy treatment. The results were statistically analyzed. In both subgroups, we analyzed the reduction of pain using a visual analog scale. The results strongly suggest that when properly fitted, class I compression corsets not only are an effective treatment for lymphedema but also could be used for antiedematous prevention in patients who underwent removal of axillary lymph nodes as well as radiotherapy. Results of these studies have also confirmed that the use of compression corsets could reduce pain associated with surgical treatment of breast cancer.</data>

Assessment for Learning (AfL) practices such as discussing examples of previous student work and giving peer feedback were embedded within the curriculum design. The metaphor of a feedback loop connected these AfL practices into a purposeful process that informed student learning as well as tutor learning about student understanding, that then informed the next teaching episode. Student teachers (n=350) in twelve tutorial groups taught by eight university tutors were able to develop a shared understanding of quality performances before completing each assessment task. As well as providing ongoing insights to improve teaching, data from this action research project enabled the participant tutor-researchers to interrogate the concept of feedback loops.

Thermoreversible crosslinking was obtained through a (retro) Diels–Alder reaction with bismaleimide, resulting in the formation of a brittle network for furan-functionalized methyl linoleate and jatropha oil. The furan-functionalized fatty esters were mixed with alternating (1,4)-polyketone reacted with furfurylamine (PK-Furan) for testing the mechanical and self-healing properties with DMTA and DSC, respectively.

      <data key="d3">Understanding the structure–function relationship in proteins is a longstanding goal in molecular and computational biology. The development of structure-based parameters has helped to relate the structure with the function of a protein. Although several structural features have been reported in the literature, no single server can calculate a wide-ranging set of structure-based features from protein three-dimensional structures. In this work, we have developed a web-based tool, PDBparam, for computing more than 50 structure-based features for any given protein structure. These features are classified into four major categories: (i) interresidue interactions, which include short-, medium-, and long-range interactions, contact order, long-range order, total contact distance, contact number, and multiple contact index, (ii) secondary structure propensities such as α-helical propensity, β-sheet propensity, and propensity of amino acids to exist at various positions of α-helix and amino acid compositions in high B-value regions, (iii) physicochemical properties containing ionic interactions, hydrogen bond interactions, hydrophobic interactions, disulfide interactions, aromatic interactions, surrounding hydrophobicity, and buriedness, and (iv) identification of binding site residues in protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid, and protein–ligand complexes. The server can be freely accessed at http://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/pdbparam/. We suggest the use of PDBparam as an effective tool for analyzing protein structures.</data>

      <data key="d3">Gene expression data hide vital information required to understand the biological process that takes place in a particular organism in relation to its environment. Deciphering the hidden patterns in gene expression data proffers a prodigious preference to strengthen the understanding of functional genomics. The complexity of biological networks and the volume of genes present increase the challenges of comprehending and interpretation of the resulting mass of data, which consists of millions of measurements; these data also inhibit vagueness, imprecision, and noise. Therefore, the use of clustering techniques is a first step toward addressing these challenges, which is essential in the data mining process to reveal natural structures and identify interesting patterns in the underlying data. The clustering of gene expression data has been proven to be useful in making known the natural structure inherent in gene expression data, understanding gene functions, cellular processes, and subtypes of cells, mining useful information from noisy data, and understanding gene regulation. The other benefit of clustering gene expression data is the identification of homology, which is very important in vaccine design. This review examines the various clustering algorithms applicable to the gene expression data in order to discover and provide useful knowledge of the appropriate clustering technique that will guarantee stability and high degree of accuracy in its analysis procedure.</data>

Numerous itemset mining algorithms have been developed in the last decade to efficiently detect specific pattern classes in data. Although many of these have proven their value for addressing bioinformatics problems, several factors still slow down promising algorithms from gaining popularity in the life science community. Many of these issues stem from the low user-friendliness of these tools and the complexity of their output, which is often large, static, and consequently hard to interpret. Here, we apply three software implementations on common bioinformatics problems and illustrate some of the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as inherent pitfalls of biological data mining. Frequent itemset mining exists in many different flavors, and users should decide their software choice based on their research question, programming proficiency, and added value of extra features.</data>

      <data key="d3">Quantum speedup of an open quantum system can be induced by the non-Markovian effect of the environment. Although an environment with a higher degree of non-Markovianity may seem like it should cause a faster speed of quantum evolution, this seemingly intuitive thinking may not always be correct. To clarify this point, we give a mechanism for controlling speedup of a single qubit that is coupled to a hierarchical photonic-crystal (PC) environment, which contains a defect single-mode cavity and a semi-infinite one-dimensional (1D) waveguide. Via studying the dynamics of the qubit, we reveal that with a judicious choice of the qubit-cavity coupling strength and the memory time of the waveguide environment, a speed-up evolution can be achieved. In particular, we found that the quantum speedup is not entirely attributed to the non-Markovianity, but to the increase of the total amount of flow information. That is the intrinsic physical reason that the hierarchical environment may induce the speed-up process. Our results may open new perspectives for detecting quantum speedup in realistic environments.</data>

      <data key="d3">Ab interno trabeculectomy is one among several recently introduced minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries that avoid a conjunctival incision and full-thickness sclerostomy involved in traditional glaucoma surgery. Ablation of the trabecular meshwork and inner wall of Schlemm’s canal is performed in an arcuate fashion via a clear corneal incision, alone or in combination with phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Intraocular pressure reduction following ab interno trabeculectomy is limited by resistance in distal outflow pathways and generally stabilizes in the mid-to-high teens. Relief of medication burden has been demonstrated by some studies. A very low rate of complications, most commonly transient hyphema and intraocular pressure elevations in the immediate postoperative period, have been reported. However, available data are derived from small retrospective and prospective case series. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to better elucidate the potential merits of ab interno trabeculectomy in the combined setting versus phacoemulsification cataract surgery alone and to compare it with other minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries.</data>

      <data key="d3">We describe a novel computational approach to identify transcription factors (TFs) that are candidate regulators in a human cell type of interest. Our approach involves integrating cell type-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data and TF data from chromatin immunoprecipitation-to-tag-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments in cell lines. To test the method, we used eQTL data from human monocytes in order to screen for TFs. Using a list of known monocyte-regulating TFs, we tested the hypothesis that the binding sites of cell type-specific TF regulators would be concentrated in the vicinity of monocyte eQTLs. For each of 397 ChIP-seq data sets, we obtained an enrichment ratio for the number of ChIP-seq peaks that are located within monocyte eQTLs. We ranked ChIP-seq data sets according to their statistical significances for eQTL overlap, and from this ranking, we observed that monocyte-regulating TFs are more highly ranked than would be expected by chance. We identified 27 TFs that had significant monocyte enrichment scores and mapped them into a protein interaction network. Our analysis uncovered two novel candidate monocyte-regulating TFs, BCLAF1 and SIN3A. Our approach is an efficient method to identify candidate TFs that can be used for any cell/tissue type for which eQTL data are available.</data>

      <data key="d3">From 2003 to 2013, Indonesia had the highest number of avian influenza A cases in humans, with 192 cases and 160 fatalities. Avian influenza is caused by influenza virus type A, such as subtype H5N1. This virus has two glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which will become the primary target to be neutralized by vaccine. Vaccine is the most effective immunologic intervention. In this study, we use the epitope-based vaccine design from hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of H5N1 Indonesian strain virus by using immunoinformatics approach in order to predict the binding of B-cell and T-cell epitopes (class I and class II human leukocyte antigen [HLA]). BCPREDS was used to predict the B-cell epitope. Propred, Propred I, netMHCpan, and netMHCIIpan were used to predict the T-cell epitope. Two B-cell epitopes of hemagglutinin candidates and one B-cell epitope of neuraminidase candidates were obtained to bind T-cell CD4+ (class II HLA), and also five T-cell epitope hemagglutinin and four T-cell epitope neuraminidase were obtained to bind T-cell CD8+ (class I HLA). The visualization of epitopes was done using MOE 2008.10. It shows that the binding affinity of epitope–HLA was based on minimum binding free energy (ΔGbinding). Based on this result, visualization, and dynamic simulation, four hemagglutinin epitopes (MEKIVLLLA, CPYLGSPSF, KCQTPMGAI, and IGTSTLNQR) and two neuraminidase epitopes (NPNQKIITI and CYPDAGEIT) were computed as having the best binding affinity from HLA ligand. The results mentioned above are from in silico experiments and need to be validated using wet experiment.</data>

      <data key="d3">The single subunit T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) is a model enzyme for studying the transcription process and for various biochemical and biophysical studies. Heparin is a commonly used inhibitor against T7RNAP and other RNA polymerases. However, exact interaction between heparin and T7RNAP is still not completely understood. In this work, we analyzed the binding pattern of heparin by docking heparin and few of its low molecular weight derivatives to T7RNAP, which helps in better understanding of T7RNAP inhibition mechanism. The efficiency of the compounds was calculated by docking the selected compounds and post-docking molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area analysis. Evaluation of the simulation trajectories and binding free energies of the complexes after simulation showed enoxaparin to be the best among low molecular weight heparins. Binding free energy analysis revealed that van der Waals interactions and polar solvation energy provided the substantial driving force for the binding process. Furthermore, per-residue free energy decomposition analysis revealed that the residues Asp 471, Asp 506, Asp 537, Tyr 571, Met 635, Asp 653, Pro 780, and Asp 812 are important for heparin interaction. Apart from these residues, most favorable contribution in all the three complexes came from Asp 506, Tyr 571, Met 635, Glu 652, and Asp 653, which can be essential for binding of heparin-like structures with T7RNAP. The results obtained from this study will be valuable for the future rational design of novel and potent inhibitors against T7RNAP and related proteins.</data>

Although the sequence and some biological features of mouse caltrin I and bovine caltrin are known, their physicochemical properties and tertiary structure are mainly unknown. We predicted the 3D structures of mouse caltrin I and bovine caltrin by molecular homology modeling and threading. Surface electrostatic potentials and electric fields were calculated using the Poisson–Boltzmann equation. Several different bioinformatics tools and available web servers were used to thoroughly analyze the physicochemical characteristics of both proteins, such as their Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy scores and helical wheel projections. The results presented in this work significantly aid further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of caltrin proteins modulating physiological processes associated with fertilization.</data>

      <data key="d3">Stereotypical behaviors induced by methamphetamine (METH) overdose are one of the overt symptoms of METH abuse, which can be easily assessed in animal models. Currently, there is no successful treatment for METH overdose. There is increasing evidence that elevated levels of brain histamine can attenuate METH-induced behavioral abnormalities, which might therefore constitute a novel therapeutic treatment for METH abuse and METH overdose. In mammals, histamine N-methyltransferase (HMT) is the sole enzyme responsible for degrading histamine in the brain. Metoprine, one of the most potent HMT inhibitors, can cross the blood-brain barrier and increase brain histamine levels by inhibiting HMT. Consequently, this compound can be a candidate for a prototype of drugs for the treatment of METH overdose.</data>

      <data key="d3">Objectives: Disruption in the natural immune reaction due to SARS-CoV-2 infection can initiate a potent cytokine storm among COVID-19 patients. An elevated level of IL-6 and IL-10 during a hyperinflammatory state plays a vital role in increasing the risk of severity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of circulating IL-6 and IL-10 levels as biomarkers for detecting the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Methods: This study was conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. Authorized databases were searched to extract suitable studies using specific search terms. RevMan 5.4 was applied for performing the meta-analysis. Mean differences in IL-6 and IL-10 levels were calculated among COVID-19 patients via a random-effects model. NOS scoring, publication bias and sensitivity analyses were checked to ensure study quality. Results: A total of 147 studies were selected, with 31 909 COVID-19 patients under investigation. In the severity analysis, the mean concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in the severe COVID-19 cases than in the non-severe cases (MD: 19.98; P &lt; .001; 95% CI: 17.56, 22.40). Similar result was observed for IL-10 mean concentration in severe COVID-19 cases (MD: 1.35; P &lt; .001; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.80). In terms of mortality analysis, circulating IL-6 showed sharp elevation in the deceased patients (MD: 42.11; P &lt; .001; 95% CI: 36.86, 47.36). IL-10 mean concentration was higher in the dead patients than in the survived patients (MD: 4.79; P &lt; .001; 95% CI: 2.83, 6.75). Publication bias was not found except for comparing IL-6 levels with disease severity. Sensitivity analysis also reported no significant deviation from the pooled outcomes. Conclusions: Elevated levels of circulating IL-6 and IL-10 signifies worsening of COVID-19. To monitor the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, IL-6 and IL-10 should be considered as potential biomarkers for severity and mortality detection in COVID-19.

      <data key="d3">Background Complete removal of the cortex has been advocated to prevent posterior capsular opacification but carries the risk of zonular dehiscence, hence there is a need for a safe maximal cortical cleanup technique in eyes with severe diffuse zonulopathy in subjects above age 90. Methods We used bimanual central cortical cleaning by elevating central fibers and aspirating them toward the periphery. Peripheral cortical fibers were removed passively only when they became loose due to copious irrigation. A one-piece foldable implant was inserted without a capsular tension ring. Postoperative corticosteroid drops were used. Results This technique was safely performed in a dozen eyes with severe pseudo-exfoliation or brunescent cataract with weak zonules. Posterior capsular rupture, iritis, vitreous loss, and lens subluxation were not observed. Moderate capsular phimosis occurred but with maintained central vision. Conclusion The dogma of “complete cortical cleanup” in severe zonulopathy needs to be revisited in favor of a clear visual axis with maximal preservation of the damaged zonules. This technique is ideal in patients above age 90 where posterior capsular opacification and late dislocation of intraocular lens–capsule bag complex are unlikely to occur until several years postoperatively.</data>

      <data key="d2">Murat Baloğlu</data>
      <data key="d3">Aim: The main aim of the study was to determine whether tonsillectomy improves the quality of life in adults suffering from chronic or recurrent tonsillitis and in rheumatologically treated patients. 
Materials and methods: This study was conducted on seropositive or seronegative patients (n=50) who were followed up with various rheumatological diagnoses (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, etc.) at the physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic of SBU Diyarbakir Gazi Yasargil Education Research Hospital and who were diagnosed with acute or chronic tonsillitis and who applied to the ENT clinic. It was done to follow the pre- and post-operative conditions. In these patients who were decided to undergo surgical treatment, HAQ (Health assessment questionnaire) quality of life scale and VAS (Visual Analog Scala) were applied to evaluate the perception of pain before and at the 6th month after the operation. 
Results: In this study of 50 adults, mean age was 28.0 years (SD 7.2 years), 38 adults were followed up in the 1st month of diagnosis, while 12 adults were followed up in the 7th month of diagnosis. All patients experienced significant improvements throughout the treatment process. According to the results of the patients' quality of life scale, it was determined that it increased significantly, primarily due to improvements in general and physical areas. 96% (96/100) of participating patients reported benefiting from tonsillectomy. Patients in the postoperative control group had significantly higher quality of life scores than patients in the preoperative case group (p &lt; 0.001). 
Conclusion: Adult patients who underwent tonsillectomy due to acute tonsillitis reported improvement in their quality of life 6 months after surgery. Based on this, physical examination of rheumatological patients who have rheumatological diseases and have undergone tonsillectomy and it is likely to improve general health, create a sense of well-being in patients, and improve overall quality of life. The social benefits of tonsillectomy appear to be negligible. The effects are likely to be long-lasting and have a greater impact on younger patients. The presence of chronic rheumatological disease due to tonsillar inflammation and infective symptoms are the main factors affecting the severity of the disease.</data>

      <data key="d3">Dear editor 
 
We have read and reviewed the article entitled as “Evaluation of choroidal thickness changes after phacoemulsification surgery” by Bayhan et al1 with great interest. The authors had analyzed the effects of phacoemulsification surgery on choroidal thickness (CT) using optical coherence tomography by postoperative month 1. They had found that there were statistically significant increases in all CT measurements, particularly in subfoveal and nasal areas, and the increase in CT was correlated with postoperative decrease of postoperative intraocular pressure. We express our gratitude to the authors for this valuable study, and we would like to ask the authors some important points. 
 
Although there is not a full consensus between Bayhan et al and other studies in the literature concerning the effects of cataract surgery on CT, an increase in CT has been reported. Various studies have proposed that the increase in CT might be induced by inflammatory changes following cataract surgery and decreased postoperative intraocular pressure.2,3 
 
In the study of Bayhan et al, we suppose that there was a different reason for increased postoperative CT, particularly for the one observed in the subfoveal area. As it is well known, the sharpest area of vision is the fovea, and the choroid beneath foveal area is called subfoveal choroid. Decreased visual function due to cataract may cause metabolic slowdown and subfoveal thinning. Synchronously, the choroid supporting that area may get thin in parallel with reduced metabolic demand of fovea. We suggest that this state may be related to the atrophy of unused organs. Therefore, we predict that an additional analysis regarding the correlation of preoperative visual acuity with preoperative CT may clarify that issue. In this regard, we would like to ask for the authors’ opinion. 
 
Second, it has been suggested in the literature that CT may be utilized for assessing the diagnosis, outcomes, and follow-up of numerous local or systemic diseases.4,5 However, all these studies have revealed quite different and conflicting results. It has been well known that dozens of factors including menstrual cycle, psoriasis, systemic medicines, and lighting conditions of the environment where optical coherence tomography measurements are performed may influence CT.4,5 Therefore, all of the known factors affecting CT or possible factors that may affect CT should be standardized in studies concerning CT measurements. In this way, an accurate scientific analysis may be performed.</data>

      <data key="d3">A long-standing objective in modern biology is to characterize the molecular components that drive the development of an organism. At the heart of eukaryotic development lies gene regulation. On the molecular level, much of the research in this field has focused on the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to regulatory regions in the genome known as cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). However, relatively little is known about the sequence-specific binding preferences of many TFs, especially with respect to the possible interdependencies between the nucleotides that make up binding sites. A particular limitation of many existing algorithms that aim to predict binding site sequences is that they do not allow for dependencies between nonadjacent nucleotides. In this study, we use a recently developed computational algorithm, MARZ, to compare binding site sequences using 32 distinct models in a systematic and unbiased approach to explore nucleotide dependencies within binding sites for 15 distinct TFs known to be critical to Drosophila development. Our results indicate that many of these proteins have varying levels of nucleotide interdependencies within their DNA recognition sequences, and that, in some cases, models that account for these dependencies greatly outperform traditional models that are used to predict binding sites. We also directly compare the ability of different models to identify the known KRUPPEL TF binding sites in CRMs and demonstrate that a more complex model that accounts for nucleotide interdependencies performs better when compared with simple models. This ability to identify TFs with critical nucleotide interdependencies in their binding sites will lead to a deeper understanding of how these molecular characteristics contribute to the architecture of CRMs and the precise regulation of transcription during organismal development.</data>

METHODS Right premolars in 32 patients were loaded with 4oz or 7oz of orthodontic force for 7 days. Left first premolars were not loaded. After 7 days, premolars were extracted for treatment as indicated. OPG and RANKL mRNA expressions were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and ELISA was used to assess OPG and RANKL protein concentration in compression and tension sides of PDL. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey tests. RESULTS There was statistically significant difference in RANKL concentration on comparing control teeth with tension and compression sides of the experimental teeth (P &lt; 0.0001). The expression of mRNA RANKL was increased in the tension and compression sides with 4oz (P &lt; 0.0001). OPG did not show statistically significant association with any group. Changes in RANKL/OPG protein ratio in experimental and control groups showed statistically significant difference (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS RANKL protein levels are elevated in hPDL loaded with orthodontic forces, suggesting that RANKL protein contributes to bone modeling in response to the initial placement of orthodontic force.</data>

The flap is floated and stroked in the same way as is done for management of first postoperative day striae, where the method is to float and irrigate the flap into position, followed by applying gentle pressure on the flap with a wet Merocel microsponge and moving the flap away from the hinge position. The sponge is then manually squeezed to become drier, and the flap is continuously stroked in a direction opposite to the hinge. Next, the flap is carefully twisted obliquely and sequentially in two opposite directions while applying gentle pressure on the flap in order to completely dehydrate the flap and stromal bed. Finally, the flap is repositioned while applying gentle horizontal pressure in two opposite directions.

      <data key="d3">Purpose To assess those published cases of yellow fever (YF) vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease that meet the Brighton Collaboration criteria and to assess the safety of YF vaccine with respect to viscerotropic disease. Literature search Ten electronic databases were searched with no restriction of date or language and reference lists of retrieved articles. Methods All abstracts and titles were independently read by two reviewers and data independently entered by two reviewers. Results All serious adverse events that met the Brighton Classification criteria were associated with first YF vaccinations. Sixty-two published cases (35 died) met the Brighton Collaboration viscerotropic criteria, with 32 from the US, six from Brazil, five from Peru, three from Spain, two from the People’s Republic of China, one each from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, and the UK, and four with no country stated. Two cases met both the viscerotropic and YF vaccine-associated neurologic disease criteria. Seventy cases proposed by authors as viscerotropic disease did not meet any Brighton Collaboration viscerotropic level of diagnostic certainty or any YF vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease causality criteria (37 died). Conclusion Viscerotropic disease is rare in the published literature and in pharmacovigilance databases. All published cases were from developing countries. Because the symptoms are usually very severe and life threatening, it is unlikely that cases would not come to medical attention (but might not be published). Because viscerotropic disease has a highly predictable pathologic course, it is likely that viscerotropic disease post-YF vaccine occurs in low-income countries with the same incidence as in developing countries. YF vaccine is a very safe vaccine that likely confers lifelong immunity.</data>

      <data key="d3">When treating persons with schizophrenia, delaying time to relapse is a main goal. Antipsychotic medication has been the primary treatment approach, and there are a variety of different choices available. Lurasidone is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agent that is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Three long-term studies of lurasidone have examined time to relapse in persons with schizophrenia, including a classic placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal study and two 12-month active comparator studies (vs risperidone and vs quetiapine extended-release). Lurasidone 40–80 mg/d evidenced superiority over placebo (number needed to treat [NNT] vs placebo for relapse, 9). Lurasidone 40–160 mg/d was noninferior to quetiapine extended-release 200–800 mg/d on the outcome of relapse, and was superior on the outcome of avoidance of hospitalization (NNT 8) and the outcome of remission (NNT 7). Lurasidone demonstrated a lower risk for long-term weight gain than the active comparators. Demonstrated differences in tolerability profiles among the different choices of antipsychotics make it possible to attempt to match up an individual patient to the best choice for such patient based on past history of tolerability, comorbidities, and personal preferences, potentially improving adherence.</data>

 Introduction: Radiation therapy is often used as the main or adjunctive treatment for cancer in the oral cavity. Unfortunately, prolonged exposure to radiation has adverse effects on tissues of the oral cavity, including a decrease in the hardness of dentin. Consequently, patients who receive radiation therapy are susceptible to tooth sensitivity and caries. Fluoride treatments have proven to be effective in restoring the hardness of dentin as it remineralizes the tooth. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal fluoride treatment for restoring the hardness of irradiated teeth.
 Methods: 100 teeth were extracted, cleaned, and mounted in acrylic resin. The teeth were ground and polished to expose the dentin and enamel. The initial Knoop hardness of the teeth was measured and split equally among five groups and treated as follows: (1) sodium fluoride varnish (SF), (2) MI varnish (MI), (3) silver diamine fluoride and potassium iodide (SDFKI), (4) silver diamine fluoride (SDF), and (5) no treatment (NT). All groups were subjected to 2 grays of daily radiation treatment for 6 weeks. The hardness of the dentin was measured immediately following radiation. Afterwards, the 5 treatments were applied weekly for 6 weeks. Hardness was measured 1 week after each treatment. Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance on ranks was used to compare the different groups.
 Results: After 6 weeks of fluoride treatment, there was a significant difference (p = 0.013) between the hardness of the irradiated enamel, with Group 4 resulting in the largest median measurement (263.4). Similarly, 5 weeks of fluoride application resulted in a mean hardness of dentin that was 15.8%, 13.6%, 16.2%, and 19.4% higher than the control for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Again, Group 4 had the highest hardness measurement.
 Conclusions: Radiation therapy decreases the hardness of enamel and dentin. SDF treatment resulted in the highest hardness for both irradiated dentin and enamel, suggesting that SDF is promising as a fluoride treatment for those undergoing radiation therapy for oral cancer.

 While progression to metastatic disease is the main cause of cancer death, little is known about the genomic mechanisms that drive metastasis. Rapidly growing clinical genomic data sets have the potential to identify genomic biomarkers of cancer metastasis, however, manual curation of clinical data is quickly emerging as a bottleneck. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify organs affected by metastasis from radiology reports of patients with cancer. To develop our NLP models, we leveraged the AACR GENIE Biopharma Collaborative lung and colorectal cancer datasets generated in part at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), containing curated labels of ten metastatic disease sites derived from 31,445 corresponding free-text radiology reports (2,310 patients). Using these data, we trained three machine learning models for identifying metastatic events from clinical text, using logistic regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We split patients into a training set (80% of patients) and validation set (20%). The BERT model yielded superior performance across evaluation metrics, with an average per metastatic disease site area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.981, average accuracy of 97.3%, macro-average precision/recall of 85.1/85.6, and micro-average precision/recall of 87.5/89.6. We applied our method to radiology reports from 52,000 patients with tumors prospectively profiled using the MSK-IMPACT clinical sequencing cohort. A comparison with the MSK-MET cohort, which contains metastatic events derived from billing codes in a subset of 25,000 patients, showed strong concordance (79.7% of metastatic events matched), with the NLP-based method identified an average of 1.4 additional metastatic sites per patient, an expected result given the incomplete nature of the billing code data. Analyzing genomic and clinical data in this cohort, we confirmed that chromosomal instability, as inferred by the fraction of genome altered (FGA), is strongly correlated with metastatic burden (defined as the number of distinct organs affected by metastases) in several tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and HR-positive breast ductal carcinoma, and we identified this trend in 10 additional cancer types not previously identified, including lobular HR-positive breast carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma.We demonstrate that mining of electronic health records can be used to extract rich, structured clinical information. Our models, applied at scale, offer a unique resource for the investigation of the biological basis for metastatic spread. We hope our automated clinical data extractions can enable further large-scale studies of associations between genomic biomarkers and metastatic behavior.

An oligonucleotide microarray was utilized to identify differentially-expressed genes in ESCC using 31 pairs of matched normal/tumor samples from Hong Kong and Henan, China. Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) was among the top down-regulated genes, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role. Public cDNA microarray data also shows significant down-regulation of ECM1 expression in ESCC. Interestingly, this gene has been extensively studied in breast cancer and thyroid cancer for its oncogenic role. There are three alternatively-spliced variants of ECM1. Therefore, this gene was selected for further variant expression and functional analysis in ESCC. Results: RNA sequencing analysis of matched normal/ESCC samples showed that ECM1b (NM_022664) is the dominant expressed variant in esophagus, followed by ECM1a (NM_004425). In tumor samples, the expression of ECM1a is down-regulated and that of ECM1b is down-regulated or lost, as compared to normal counterparts. Expression of ECM1c (NM_001202858) is not detected in either normal or tumor samples. Quantitative PCR using variant-specific primer sets confirms the findings of microarray and RNA sequencing analyses. When re-expressed in ESCC cell lines after lentiviral transduction, ECM1b expression shows a trend of tumor suppression in the orthotopic ESCC mouse tumorigenicity model; ECM1a shows no tumor-suppressive effect in either. ECM1b expression also shows a metastasis inhibitory effect in a tail vein experimental metastasis model. Immunohistochemical staining shows E-cadherin up-regulation in orthotopic tumors re-expressing ECM1b. Conclusions: These results suggest differential roles of variants of ECM1 in ESCC. Unlike the cases in other types of cancer, both expression of ECM1a and ECM1b is down-regulated in ESCC compared to normal esophageal tissues. ECM1b represents the dominantly expressed variants in esophagus epithelium, and its expression is highly reduced in esophageal carcinoma. ECM1b plays a potential suppressive role in tumorigenesis and metastasis.

      <data key="d3">Organotypic 3D cell culture models combined with screening modalities and automated high-content image analyses provide tools to gain a spectrum of biologically relevant information simultaneously from drug responses in tumor cells. This includes information about cell growth, death, differentiation and tumor cell invasion. In this study, we examined the phenotypic drug responses of prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP, and breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (SA) and MCF-7 cultured in a miniaturized, imaging-optimized, Matrigel-based organotypic screening platform. We demonstrate the use of the 3D cell culture technology combined with automated morphometric image data analysis software AMIDA, for phenotypic, high-content screening. The emerging tumor organoids were treated with the cytostatic drugs doxorubicin, docetaxel and paclitaxel, a selective inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (WAY170523), and with ROCK-inhibitors RKI-1447 and Y-27632. Treatments were conducted at seven different drug concentrations for 4-10 days. At the end point, confocal live cell images were captured and analyzed using AMIDA. Among others, the numerical data representing cell growth (Area) and cell invasion (Appendages) were visualized and used for statistics. EC50 values were calculated based on the Area-parameter derived from AMIDA analysis. All cell lines initially formed multicellular, round organoids. PC-3 cells formed round and well-differentiated structures but spontaneously converted around day 9 of culture into structures showing massive, string-like collective invasion into the surrounding matrix. A different pattern of cell invasion was observed in MDA-MB-231 organoids, which developed strong and multicellular extensions by day 7-8. Interestingly, both ROCK-inhibitors promoted the invasion of PC-3 cells, as detected by phenotypic analysis with AMIDA. In contrast, Y-27632 reduced the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas both ROCK-inhibitors induced cell invasion in MCF-7 cells at high concentration. WAY170523 inhibited the invasion of PC-3 cells but not of MDA-MB-231 cells, pointing to a different mechanism of invasiveness. All cell lines were highly sensitive to doxorubicin, docetaxel and paclitaxel at nanomolar range, as detected by the decrease of cell invasion, reduced organoid size, and increased cell death. The breast cancer cells were more sensitive to taxanes than PC-3 cells. Organotypic 3D cultures combined with high-content phenotypic analysis with AMIDA software provide a quantitative view of drug effects and enable assessment of differential drug responses on various cell lines.

      <data key="d3">Osimertinib is currently the preferred treatment for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients due to its superior therapeutic efficacy and prolonged overall survival compared to earlier generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but durable responses to osimertinib treatment are rare due to acquired drug resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel strategies to treat osimertinib-resistant NSCLC. Recently, we found that treatment with MRX-2843, a novel MERTK-selective kinase inhibitor currently in Phase I clinical trials, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of cell expansion and colony formation in an osimertinib-resistant (osiR) H4006 derivative cell line. An unbiased screen of 378 kinase inhibitors was carried out to identify compounds that synergized with MRX-2843 to inhibit expansion of an osiR derivative of the EGFR-mutated H4011 cell line. Treatment with 1µM PIM kinase inhibitor SGI-1776 or 100nM MRX-2843 alone reduced cell density by 5±3% and 44±7%, respectively, while treatment with MRX-2843 and SGI-1776 combined mediated an 82±0.4% decrease. Synergy was also observed in H4006 osiR and H1650 osiR derivative cell lines. Furthermore, treatment with PIM447, a structurally distinct PIM kinase inhibitor, and MRX-2843 decreased cell expansion more effectively than either agent alone. Mechanistically, treatment with a PIM kinase inhibitor in combination with MRX-2843 decreased downstream PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK signaling more effectively than single agents. Additionally, combined treatment with MRX-2843 and SGI-1776 prevented colony formation, while single agents had limited effect. In all, these data indicate that combining MRX-2843 and a PIM TKI may control osimertinib resistant tumor growth, providing a potential treatment strategy for osimertinib resistant EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients for whom the choices are still limited.

 Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that link an extracellular tumor specific domain to intracellular signaling domains. Despite of remarkable results against refractory B cell malignancies, intense effort is underway to augment the potency of CAR T cells in order to overcome the suppressive tumor microenvironment, which is associated with T cell exhaustion. Adenosine is a major mediator of immune suppression. Ectoenzyme CD39 plays a central role in the generation of adenosine by catalyzing the metabolism of ATP into ADP/AMP. Then CD73 subsequently metabolizes ADP/AMP into adenosine which mediates immune suppression through adenosine associated receptor signaling. CD39 is also expressed by exhausted CD8+ and tumor reactive T cells within the tumor microenvironment, where it is associated with tumor progression, but it remains unclear whether exhausted and/or tumor reactive CD39+CD8+ T cells mediate immune suppression via the purigenic pathway. We developed a high affinity version of the disialoganglioside (GD2)-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (HA-GD2) that spontaneously clusters on the surface of human T cells in the absence of antigen and mimics chronic antigen exposure leading to T cell exhaustion. Using this model, we demonstrate that exhausted CD39+CD8+ CAR T cells actively produce adenosine and mediate immune suppression. In an attempt to generate adenosine resistance and enhance the function of exhausted CAR T cells, we knocked out CD39, CD73, or A2aR (adenosine A2a receptor) but observed only modest changes in phenotype and transcriptomics. In contrast, overexpression of transmembrane-bound adenosine deaminase, which metabolizes adenosine to inosine, induced higher frequency of stem- and central- like memory T cells, and a simultaneous decrease of exhausted T cell subpopulations. Direct exposure of HA-GD2 CAR T cells to high inosine concentration during cell manufacturing process, lead to a higher frequency of central-like memory cells and significant fitness enhancement associated with broad changes at the metabolic level. RNAseq and cyTOF analysis indicated decreased glycolytic flux, increased mitochondrial activity driven by glutamine and polyamine metabolism. Further, inosine altered the epigenetic state of HA-GD2 CAR T cells. We observed significant enrichment of IRF and NF-κB transcription factor motifs and motifs associated with memory differentiation in T cells grown in the presence of inosine. Finally, we showed that production of exhausted HA-GD2 and clinical GD2 CAR T cells in inosine-containing culture media enhances their in vivo efficacy, leading to improved survival in GD2+ tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, we propose introducing inosine during GMP cell manufacturing as a novel strategy to improve CAR T function and subsequent clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapy.

      <data key="d3">Background: The prognosis of Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is very poor, the new drug for MPM is need. IL-6 in serum with MPM patients is high, IL-6/Stat3 pathway is activated. We investigated that Stat3 is the potential target for the treatment of MPM. Methods: Cell viability was assayed with Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8: WST-8 Dojindo). MPM cells (NCI-H28, NCI-H226, NCI-H2052, NCI-H2452, MSTO-211H) were seeded into 96-wellplates. After the treatment with Stat3 inhibitor (BBI-608). Cell Counting Kit-8 solution was added to each well of the plate and measured the absorbance using a microplate reader. The levels of phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3) were measured in cell lysates using an InstantOne ELISA assays (eBioscience). The translocated p-Stat3, c-Myc were analyzed by Confocal immunofluorescent. In vivo study, H226 cells were injected into the subcutaneous over the flank region of nude mice. Mice were randomly assigned into four groups (5 mice each group) 1) vehicle control 2) treated with BBI-608 3) Radiation 4) BBI608/RT. Tumor is measured twice per week. Results: BBI-608 inhibited MPM cell lines (NCI-H28, NCI-H226, NCI-H2052, NCI-H2452, MSTO-211H) viability in a dose-dependent manner. The level of p-Stat3 was decreased 90% by BBI-608 10μM treatment in H226. Untreated H226, p-stat3 was observed in cytoplasma and localized in the nucleus. As compared with untreated cells, p-stat3, c-Myc were decrease in cytoplasma and was not localized in the nucleus with BBI-608 treated cells. BBI-608 suppressed tumor growth (p Conclusion: In this study, we have shown that BBI-608 inhibited the proliferation of all MPM cell (epithelial, biphasic, sarcomatoid) lines and inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation and blocked the translocation to the nucleus. We also demonstrated that BBBI-608 completely suppressed tumor growth with radiation in mouse model. Furthermore, Stat3 inhibitor with Radiation Therapy (START) is promising in MPM therapy.

      <data key="d3">Background and Aim The incidence of cancer cachexia varies greatly among tumor type. Although certain tumor types are more commonly associated with cachexia, even for the same tumor type, the degree to which patients exhibit cachexia varies. This is due to variations in tumor phenotype and host genotype that contributes to the development of cancer cachexia. The influence of the site of tumor growth on the development of cancer cachexia remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated if differences in tumor microenvironment would affect the development of cancer cachexia in a murine model. Methods The same number of colon26 cells (5×10⁁6 cells/mouse) was inoculated subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in 8-week-old male BALB/c mice. Body weight, food intake, and tumor size were monitored. On day 14 after the tumor inoculation, mice were anesthetized and blood collected, and the weight of peritesticular adipose tissue, gastrocnemius muscle and heart were measured. 23 plasma cytokines were determined by using the Bio-Plex array system and plasma Myostatin and Activin A levels were measured by ELISA. Expression of MuRF-1 and Antrogin-1, which are required for muscle atrophy, in gastrocnemius muscle or heart was assessed by RT-PCR. Results The body weight, adipose tissue and gastrocnemius muscle decreased in tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, a reduction in heart weight was observed in the intraperitoneal tumor group but not in the subcutaneous group. The weight loss of the body, adipose tissue and gastrocnemius was more severe in the intraperitoneal group than in the subcutaneous group. Atrogin 1 and MuRF1 mRNA expressions in the gastrocnemius muscle increased significantly in both groups of tumor-bearing mice, however, in the myocardium, expression of these mRNAs increased in the intraperitoneal group but not in subcutaneous group. As for plasma cytokine levels, several cytokine levels including IL-6, TNF-α, and activing A of tumor-bearing mice were significantly higher than those of control mice. Eotaxin and G-CSF levels in the intraperitoneal tumor group were higher than in the subcutaneous group. Conclusion Based on these data, we believe that differences in microenvironment where tumor cells develop can affect the progression and phenotype of cancer cachexia through alterations in various circulating factors derived from the tumor microenvironment.

 Genomic profiling of glioblastoma uncovers fundamental differences in the driver events of malignant transformation and progression, yet the nuances driving the particular growth rate of glioblastoma in individual patients remain poorly defined. We exploited the availability of fourteen histocompatibility-matched mouse hosts from the collaborative cross (CC) [PMID: 15514660] as hosts for a non-germline, engineered model of murine glioblastoma [PMCID: PMC4210043] to interrogate cell types, functional states and proximity in situ in tumors with varying growth rates. Specifically, Kaplan-Meier survival data was used to determine the rates of Nf1:TP53 null tumor growth in different cc host groups. Spatial transcriptomics and single nucleus RNA seq (sn-seq) analyses were conducted in tumor-bearing brain tissue from C57Bl/6 (syngeneic) and 2 CC histocompatible allogeneic mouse strains with differential survival outcomes. Spatial analysis was conducted using a disease-focused multiplexed mRNA probe set assembled from annotations of GBM/glioma specific genes reported in the literature. Cell segmentation of the data was performed to investigate the spatial pattern of single-cell level expression. The spatial transcriptomic dataset was also analyzed with a segmentation-free pipeline. In addition, to detect cell clusters, the probability of genes detected in close proximity (genes within a cell 5px radius [0.5 um]) was determined using Pdgfra as the tumor marker (anchor). We identified differential levels of spatially correlated expression of cell clusters expressing hypoxia markers such as HIF-1a and PDK1 between hosts with fast and slow growing tumors. Tumors from the 3 hosts were also processed for sn-seq. Integrated analysis of cell clustering was used to determine differences in clusters between the fast growing and slow growing groups. Enrichment of expression of Top2a, a gene associated with proliferation and poor prognosis in glioma, was detected in a unique cluster of cells in the slow-growing tumor when compared to the fast-growing group. This suggests that the host microenvironment may play a role in influencing the decelerated growth of this tumor. These results support the utility of spatial transcriptomics and sn-seq in understanding how differences in tumor:host cell interactions contribute to tumor growth. Future opportunities enabled by histocompatible allogeneic hosts for GEM and nGEM glioma models include unraveling host effects on drug sensitivity, tumor heterogeneity, molecular plasticity, angiogenesis, invasion, and lymphoid and myeloid microenvironmental dependencies, each with profound opportunities for clinical translation.

      <data key="d3">Background: Rethink Breast Cancer has been offering educational resources and front-line psychosocial and practical support to younger women with breast cancer for over ten years. We have heard first-hand the unique issues that these women face. Some of these challenges include diagnosis during pregnancy, effects of chemotherapy on fertility, risk of menopausal symptoms or osteoporosis, feelings of isolation, questions about sexuality, childcare, relationships, dating, employment and money. Purpose: Health Canada and the Canadian Medical Association have established comprehensive Clinical practice guidelines for the care and treatment of breast cancer and our Provincial Cancer Agencies, the Canadian Association of Nurses in Oncology (CANO) and the Canadian Association of Psychosocial Oncology (CAPO) all have developed excellent Standards of Care. However, our report, Breast Cancer in Young Women in Canada – A Needs Assessment, finds that younger women9s needs continue to fall through the cracks. The report also shows that despite a growing array of peer support based interventions and community resources for young women with breast cancer, their needs are often not being met by current healthcare systems. In response to the feedback from young women experiencing breast cancer in Canada provided in our report, Rethink Breast Cancer has developed a set of recommended Care Guidelines for Young Women with Breast Cancer to ensure their special needs are addressed (in a timely matter). They serve as a compliment to the guidelines mentioned above. Methods: The care guidelines have been developed in consultation with Rethink9s Young Women9s Network, a group comprised of young women across the Canada that have personal experience with breast cancer and are interested in Rethink9s unique role within the breast cancer community. The network provides important input and feedback on our resources and campaigns for young women dealing with breast cancer. The care guidelines were also developed through consultation with our professional advisors in oncology, nursing and psychosocial support. They are based on original work by UK specialist breast cancer support charity Breast Cancer Care. Results &amp; Conclusions: These guidelines provide information about key issues individuals may want to discuss with their healthcare providers involved in their breast cancer treatment and care. They are recommendations on the kind of information and support to which individuals should be given access to as a younger woman with breast cancer. They will also serve to guide the care these individuals receive from healthcare professionals. Citation Format: DeCoteau MJ. Care guidelines for young women diagnosed with breast cancer. [abstract].

      <data key="d3">The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cell signaling pathway. It plays a central role in cell fate decisions and differentiation. The bioavailability of sclareol has been widely studied due to its anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects. However, chemo preventive effects of sclareol on notch signaling in 7, 12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA) induced hamster buccal pouch(HBP) carcinogenesis remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, tumors were induced by applying 0.5% DMBA topically to HBP thrice a week for 14 weeks and sclareol was orally administered at a dose of 20mg/kg body weight on alternate days of DMBA painting. We analyzed expression of Notch signaling in DMBA induced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in experimental oral carcinogenesis and inhibition of notch signaling by sclareol. This study thus observed up regulation of Notch1, Notch2, Jagged1, Hes1 and Hey1 in DMBA alone induced hamsters. Furthermore, oral administration of sclareol led to reduced Notch1, Notch2 activation and expression of Jagged-1 and its downstream targets of Hes-1 and Hey-1 in tumor bearing hamsters. In addition, sclareol treatment increased pro-apoptotic and decreased anti-apoptotic proteins survival indicating apoptosis through activation of caspase 3, and promoting cell death by dysregulation of cyclin D1 levels in tumor bearing hamsters. Immunohistochemical examination showed that Notch intracellular domain accumulates in the nucleus of cells in DMBA induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis, and Jagged1 was found to be dysregulated in sclareol treated tumor animals. In conclusion, the results provide an important new insight of Notch signaling pathway for a potential therapeutic target for oral cancer.

The incidence of women who become pregnant while on chemotherapy is less clear but does occur. Amenorrhea commonly occurs during chemotherapy but this does not necessarily correlate with lack of ovarian function. Treating a patient with an unidentified pregnancy is an adverse event which must be avoided given the high risk it poses to the fetus, especially during the first trimester. Pregnancy testing prior to the initiation of chemotherapy is recommended by the NCCN and ASCO. However, recommendations on how to monitor for pregnancy after an initial screen are inconsistent and lack standardization. Formal guidelines and policies are needed to prevent and/or identify pregnancies while on chemotherapy. We surveyed five breast medical oncologists and six infusion nurses at a busy urban breast center to determine their baseline practices in regards to pregnancy counseling and testing. Of physicians and nurses surveyed, 40% (2/5) and 33% (2/6) respectively have diagnosed a pregnancy while on chemotherapy. When surveyed about counseling patients on the risks of pregnancy, 80% of physicians counsel patients prior to initiation of chemotherapy, but one physician and one infusion nurse said they do not counsel patients about the risk of pregnancy at any time but do discuss the risks of infertility. All physicians surveyed check a pregnancy test prior to the initiation of chemotherapy, but 60% check urine and 40% check serum. Thereafter 60% will check a pregnancy test after initial screen if the patient is concerned and 40% will check intermittently during chemotherapy. Of the nurses surveyed, 33% will check a pregnancy test after initial screen if the patient is concerned and 50% check intermittently during treatment. Half of the infusion nurses said they ask patients if they are concerned they may be pregnant intermittently during chemotherapy and 50% answered that they do not ask again after the initial screen. On subsequent screens the choice of urine or serum hCG testing varies and is not standardized. These survey results demonstrate that both pregnancy counseling and pregnancy screening practices vary widely even within the same institution. A standardized approach is essential to increase awareness of pregnancy risk while on chemotherapy, improve education of this risk to patients, prevent unwanted pregnancies, and identify pregnancies as soon as possible. We have initiated a quality improvement project to check urine pregnancy tests monthly in all premenopausal patients (age Citation Format: Berger N, Fitzpatrick K, Klein P.

      <data key="d3">Goal: New and improved treatments depend on the completion of successful clinical trials. Our goal is to impact all aspects of the clinical trial process to enhance accrual and outcomes. 1) To provide patient focused feedback at the design phase of clinical trials 2) To increase health literacy about clinical trials at both the national and community level 3) To provide decision aids for individual trials 4) To provide patient focused staff communication trainings Strategy: CISN principals are currently working with the following groups National Clinical Trial Network Academic Medical Centers: UCSF and Mayo Industry: Genentech, Pfizer, Novartis, and Lilly Nonprofit Organizations: AACR, Faster Cures, Susan G. Komen, SOCRA CISN principals are working within the NCTN to accomplish strategies one and two. The goal is to branch out to more community venues in the future. A 2001 study by Lara et. al. reported that the consent process with its legalistic and confusing forms is itself a barrier to patient participation with 49% of eligible patients declining enrollment. We address these concerns by accomplishing strategies 3 and 4 above. Action Taken CISN is introducing the medical community to an array of issues affecting patients considering participation in clinical trials. They are also developing patient-centered, study specific, educational materials included as part of the informed consent process. These interventions may enhance patient literacy, improve patient satisfaction and advance public trust in the research enterprise, leading to responsible increased accrual and retention. Additionally, CISN has worked as a contractor for several biotech companies to develop patient educational materials for several studies. Work done at the Clinical Trial Summit documented that 67% of professionals consenting patients have less than 6 hours of psychosocial training. To address that issue, CISN developed a training program for those professionals who administer consent. Two PhD psychologists where brought onboard as consultants to assist in the development of the training. To date CISN has conducted many trainings for various groups and will soon submit grants to partner with other organizations to translate the materials into Spanish and work with patient navigators to further ensure proper training in all communities. Outcome Interest in our methods and materials continues to grow. CISN was identified by Faster Cures as having "best practice" methods in the area of informed consent. We work closely with academic, government, other non-profits and industry researchers to help foster public awareness about the importance of medical research to daily life. CISN addresses these issues and presents various strategies that might be applied to NCI network group and industry trials so as to bridge the research gap, move research forward, and adopt the best course to serve the needs of the community, researchers and patients.

 Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) is an exogenous cannabinoid found in the plant Cannabis sativa and is thought to have broad therapeutic value. It works via different receptors than Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and, as such, lacks the psychoactive effects associated with cannabis intoxication. While CBD is becoming more commonly used in preclinical and clinical research studies in patients with breast cancer, few studies have explored these patients’ attitudes toward CBD use outside of the research setting. This survey study aimed to characterize the rate of and benefits from CBD use in patients with breast cancer, while also identifying barriers and limitations to its use. Methods: Individuals being seen at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center for a diagnosis of breast cancer were given a flyer inviting them to participate in an online survey characterizing current and former CBD use. The survey questions were adapted from a previously published questionnaire conducted in patients with chronic pain conditions. All data was collected anonymously. The survey was accessed between September 2020 and March 2021. Survey responses were excluded if a patient had no history of breast cancer diagnosis or if a majority of the survey was incomplete. Results: A total of 114 survey responses meeting criteria for inclusion were collected. Most respondents were female (n = 113), White (n = 101, 88.6%) and the average age was 55.7 years (range 30-96 years). 51 respondents (44.8%) reported an annual household income of over $100,000. 83 respondents (72.8%) were currently receiving treatment for breast cancer. 44 respondents (38.6%) had ever used CBD to manage pain or other symptoms, and 26 of the 44 (59%) reported current use of CBD. Of the 18 patients who no longer used CBD, the most common reasons reported for stopping its use were lack of efficacy (35%) and expense (25%). Negative side effects were reported by 5%. Respondents continuing to use CBD most often reported using it to manage pain (19%), anxiety (18%), insomnia (15%), and joint stiffness (15%). It was less commonly used to manage depression (8%), fatigue (7%), and memory (4%). On a continuous scale of 1 (very much worse) to 7 (very much improved), respondents reported a median change in pain with CBD use of 6 (range 4 - 7, n=17), a median change in anxiety of 5.6 (range 4.1 - 7, n=16), a median change in insomnia of 6.3 (range 4 - 7, n=13) and a median change in joint stiffness of 5.6 (range 3 - 7, n=13). 61 respondents (53.5%) reported never using CBD to manage pain or other symptoms; the most common reasons were lack of symptoms (12%) or well-controlled symptoms (13%), lack of research on CBD use (15%), lack of regulation and fear of production contamination (14%), worry about side effects associated with CBD use (14%), and interactions with other medications (12%). Few respondents were concerned about expense (2%), CBD’s legal status (4%), or family and friends’ opinions (3%). Conclusions: While less than half of patients in this survey study reported previous or current CBD use, breast cancer patients who are using CBD seem to derive symptomatic benefit from reduction in pain and improvement in insomnia. Barriers to use of CBD include expense, concern about lack of CBD research, and concern about its interaction with other medications. While negative side effects were rarely reported in former CBD users, this remained a top concern for patients who had never used CBD. As CBD becomes increasingly used in the clinical setting, it will be important for physicians to help navigate these concerns related to its use. Additional research is needed to determine which patient-reported symptoms are most likely to be impacted by CBD use, as use in this patient population could lead to improvement in quality of life.

      <data key="d3">Background Accredited cancer treatment centers offer clinical trials for patients since it is universally accepted that participation in these trials is advantageous. Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess whether clinical trial participation was associated with a survival advantage. Methods We identified 308,291 cases of first primary female invasive breast cancer from the California Cancer Registry 2000-2015. Participation in a clinical trial was documented. Clinical trials were defined as National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored studies such as National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG); pharmaceutical trials; and local investigator initiated studies. The distribution of age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and stage between clinical trial participants and non-participants was compared using contingency tables and the χ2 Test. Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis and the Log Rank test were used to compare differences in breast cancer specific survival between participants and non-participants. Cox Regression Analysis was used to estimate the risk of mortality between participants and non-participants after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, SES, grade, and treatment. Analyses were conducted separately for each stage. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Results There were 3,517 (1.1%) patients who participated in a clinical trial. Almost 50% of participants were enrolled in an NCI trial, 38% in a local/investigator initiated study, and 13% were in a trial sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. Trial participation was highest for patients less than 45 years of age (21.9%) and lowest in patients 70 years of age and older (12.3%). Most participants were in stage 2 (44.6%). Participation increased with increasing SES. Only 8.5% of participants were in the lowest SES whereas 35.4% were in the highest SES. Unadjusted survival analysis indicated that there was no survival advantage for stage 1 patients (χ2 = 0.41, p=0.52) whereas study participants in stages 2, 3, and 4 had statistically significantly better survival. Adjusted hazard ratios indicated that stage 2 patients participating in a trial had a 23% reduced risk of mortality (HR=0.77; CI: 0.65 - 0.94). For patients in stage 4, the risk of mortality was reduced by 36% (HR=0.64; CI: 0.47 - 0.87). There was no risk reduction for patients in stages 1 and 3. Conclusion Only a small percent of patients enroll in breast cancer clinical trials and participation is correlated with age and SES. There is a survival advantage for participation in a clinical trial for stages 2 and 4 patients. Citation Format: Parise C, Caggiano V.

      <data key="d3">The National Cancer Institute9s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is an international effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteomic and genomic analysis, or proteogenomics. Leidos Biomedical Research, a prime contractor to NCI, provides a robust infrastructure for supporting the collection and sequencing of high-quality biospecimens and data, in addition to project and subcontract management for this program. CPTAC applies the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer to identify biomarker candidates. CPTAC phase III began late 2016 to collect and analyze 200 cases of each of ten additional cancers. The cancers include sarcoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and acute myeloid leukemia. The program completed the discovery phase collection of 100 cases for 3 tumor types in the first year. The study entails collection and pathology evaluation of biospecimens, high-quality clinical data and images from clinical sites around the world. A biorepository evaluates and processes the biospecimens, sending nucleic acids to sequencing centers and tissues to proteomics groups. Data are combined and analyzed by proteogenomic data analysis and translational centers. Genomic data are made available to the research community through the NCI Genomic Data Commons. Proteomic and proteogenomic data are made available through the Data Coordinating Center. Imaging data are made available through NCI imaging archive. We report here on progress in collection of tissues and clinical data, the preliminary analysis trends and the integration of biorepository, proteomics and genomics and analysis centers.

      <data key="d3">Background and Purpose: The five-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer (PC) and diffuse-type gastric cancer (DT-GC) is far below 10%. They are known to have dense stroma unlike other types of tumors. Therefore, in the case, these two types of tumor are important to understand biological features of tumor stroma as well as that of tumor cells. However, conventional omics studies have largely focused on tumor cells. There are fewer studies in which both tumor cells and tumor stroma were examined simultaneously. In addition, among omics analysis, although genome and gene expression analysis using next generation sequencing (NGS) combined with informatics have progressed extensively, metabolomics analysis using mass spectrometry seems to be stagnated with no benefits from informatics. Hence, we have decided to develop in situ level mass spectrometry analysis combined with informatics in order to discover new biomarkers against both PC and DT-GC. Materials and Methods: First, we separated tumor cells, tumor stroma and normal cells using laser microdissection from clinical samples (5 cases of PC, 5 cases of DT-GC) and conducted trace-level metabolomics analysis using ultrasensitive capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). We obtained mass spectrometric raw data with retention time, m/z and peak area of each molecules and then created data matrices. Using these data matrices, multivariate analysis such as PCA (principal component analysis) and PLS-DA (partial least squares regression analysis) was performed. Results: In PCA results, there were no significant differences among three data groups (tumor cells, tumor stroma and normal cells) and scatter plot with grouped data didn9t follow any rules. Secondly, we conducted PLS-DA analysis and found that scatter plot was clearly divided into three groups. After calculating loading scores, we selected 20 top-ranked metabolites which is specific to each group (tumor cells, tumor stroma or normal cells) respectively. Moreover, all of them were unknown molecules and most of them had wide peak area and fast retention time. Now, we are identifying these molecules to find out which could be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of PC or DT-GC. Conclusion: We established in situ level mass spectrometry analysis and selected new biomarker candidates by loading plots in PLS-DA analysis. It is also indicated that informatics is a powerful approach to convert mass spectrometric raw data into meaningful information.

      <data key="d3">Background: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) provide a wider therapeutic index by allowing specific targeting of cytotoxic agents to tumor cells. DS-8201a is a novel HER2-targeting ADC which contains a high average drug-to-antibody-ratio (DAR) of 7-8 molecules of a topoisomerase I inhibitor (exatecan derivative, DXd) per antibody. Preclinical data demonstrated a broader antitumor activity of DS-8201a than T-DM1 (the only FDA approved HER2-targeting ADC), including efficacy against T-DM1 resistant and HER2 low-expressing tumors. The first-in-human (FIH) study, comprising a dose escalation (Part 1) and expansion (Part 2), is being conducted in patients with HER2+ breast cancer (BC), gastric cancer (GC), and other HER2 expressing tumors. This analysis was aimed to assess DS-8201a population pharmacokinetics (POPPK) and exposure-response (E-R) relationships for efficacy and key safety endpoints using data available so far, and to support Phase 2 dose selection. Methods: Preliminary data were obtained from Part 1 portion of the FIH study, in which a total of 23 patients with BC or GC received intravenous DS-8201a doses ranging from 0.8 to 8.0 mg/kg tri-weekly. Firstly, the POPPK model of DS-8201a and DXd in serum was developed and the individual-predicted exposures were derived. An exposure-driven, tumor growth inhibition (TGI) model was then fit to the longitudinal tumor sum of longest diameter (SLD) data. Additionally, the E-R relationships for thrombocytopenia (TCP) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were assessed using a cell lifespan model and a logistic regression model, respectively. Results: A 2-compartment PK model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination and a 1-compartment model with linear release and elimination best characterized the serum concentration-time profiles for DS-8201a and DXd, respectively. The TGI model for tumor SLD indicated a DS-8201a-exposure-dependent drug efficacy across the dose range tested. Model-based simulations showed that predicted % of patients exceeding pre-clinical efficacious DS-8201a concentration (4260 ng/mL) at trough was 86.7 to 95.9% during 6.4 mg/kg tri-weekly dosing, and predicted objective response rate (ORR) was approximately 50.5% in the Part 1 patient population with BC or GC. The cell lifespan modelling for TCP indicated that increased DS-8201a exposure was associated with a greater risk of grade 3 or 4 TCP but the predicted probability was low for doses of 6.4 mg/kg or below. No to minimal relationships with exposures of DS-8201a or DXd were observed for the GI toxicity. Conclusion: A series of model-based simulations demonstrated that 50% ORR was expected at 6.4 mg/kg DS-8201a tri-weekly, with limited increases in the risk of TCP and GI toxicity relative to lower doses, which supports the selection of this dose for Phase 2.

      <data key="d3">The International Pooling Project on Mammographic Density Consortium Background: Over the past 25 years, the epidemiologic knowledge for mammographic density (MD), as a strong marker of breast cancer risk, has expanded greatly, aided by the availability of mammograms in countries with wide-scale mammography-based breast cancer screening programs. The known epidemiology of this breast-tissue specific marker is thus that of women in high incidence countries, and not of that in countries with lifestyles that are characterized by very different life-long hormonal influences, especially during the reproductive years. The International Pooling Project on Mammography Density (IPPMD) aimed to examine the epidemiology of MD internationally, to benefit from breast cancer risk and breast cancer risk factor heterogeneity. Methods: From diverse breast cancer risk populations, IPPMD sought to include samples of 200 premenopausal and 200 postmenopausal general population women for which risk factor data and mammograms, not taken for symptomatic reasons, were available. To date we have included 11447 women from 22 countries, consisting of 40 ethnicity and location-specific population groups. 5 to 6 countries were included in each of Europe, Africa and the Middle East, Asia and the Americas. Populations not previously studied in terms of MD include South Africa, Kenya, Turkey, Egypt and Brazil. Digitized/digital films for every woman were anonymised, transferred to the study and read using Cumulus 6 by 3 readers, to obtain standardized quantitative and comparable MD estimates across the entire sample. Readers were blind to all woman and study/country identifiers. Normal errors regression models were used to analyse square root percent density and absolute dense area, after standardizing reader-specific values to a single reader9s distribution. Results: All risk factor data and MD readings have recently been pooled. Initial findings are as follows. Mean percent MD and absolute dense area varied over 2-fold between the 40 population groups, after adjusting for age and BMI. There is striking consistency in several epidemiologic features of MD across all population groups, including the rate of decline of density at both pre and post-menopausal ages and the decline associated with the menopausal transition. We are exploring to what extent these and other factors such as menarche, parity, age at first birth and breastfeeding, account for between population-group differences in MD. Conclusions: This international perspective provides a valuable insight to the epidemiology of MD worldwide. Citation Format: McCormack VA.

 Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive and represents nearly 20% of all breast cancer cases. It is associated with poor prognosis due to its high metastatic capabilities and lack of targeted therapeutic treatments. To improve TNBC treatment, our goal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive TNBC. Recently, inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), a nitric oxide (NO) producing enzyme, has emerged as a key player in TNBC progression. High NOS2 expression in TNBC patient correlates with poor prognosis marked with increased metastasis and disease recurrence. NOS2 catalyzes L-arginine and dioxygen (O2) to produce citrulline and high, sustained levels of NO which has been shown to alter the activity of numerous signaling pathways. Depending on NO concentration and temporal and spatial levels, it has been reported to have both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing functions. However, the mechanism by which NOS2 drives TNBC is unclear. Akt is major oncogenic signaling pathway that regulates various aspects of tumor progression, and it has been shown that NO can activate Akt activity. The Akt family has three members, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, that seem to have similar and non-redundant functions in cancer. We have discovered for the first time that NOS2 specifically activates Akt2 in TNBC cells. Thus, we hypothesize that Akt2 plays a major role in NOS2 driven TNBC. Inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α) highly induce NOS2 in mouse 4T1 TNBC cells. We developed a real-time NO detection assay to measure NO levels in 4T1 cells and confirmed that these cells produce high levels of NO. By pharmacologically and genetically inhibiting NOS2 in the 4T1 cells, we found that NOS2 suppresses Akt2 phosphorylation but not the total levels. Furthermore, NOS2 had no effect on Akt1. The decrease in Akt2 phosphorylation was accompanied by inhibition of its downstream targets, GSK3β and FOXO3a, suggesting that NOS2 is regulating Akt2 activity. Conversely, treatment of 4T1 and human MDA-MD-231 TNBC cells with DETA/NO, a slow releasing NO donor, resulted in increased Akt2 phosphorylation with no effect on Akt1. Akt2 has been shown to promote migration, invasion, and metastasis. Using 4T1 cells, we are presently studying the function of NOS2-Akt2 signaling in TNBC. We have orthotopically injected 4T1 cells into immunocompetent mice and have found that 4T1 tumors express high levels of NOS2 as well as phosphorylated Akt2. We have knocked out NOS2 in the 4T1 cells to examine the effects of NOS2 inhibition in the mouse tumor model. Understanding the link between NOS2 and Akt2 will give further understanding on how NOS2 drives TNBC.

      <data key="d3">Recent efforts by advocacy groups to enact state government mandated legislation requiring that patients with dense breast tissue be informed of their breast density has been met with mixed responses by the medical community and cancer advocacy groups. Breast density has been well characterized as a risk factor for breast cancer, and is known to make mammogram interpretation more difficult. There are no formal recommendations for additional screening and management of patients who have dense breasts. There is no standard measurement in place for what defines dense breasts on mammography. Many women9s health practitioners seeing radiology reports that comment on breast density are not adequately prepared to counsel patients in terms of best practice, as guidelines do not exist. Despite uncertainty of how knowledge of breast density impacts ongoing imaging or whether it impacts cancer early detection, 21 states have now enacted laws mandating breast density reporting It is unclear whether in states with mandatory reporting more patients are actually being informed about their breast density. "Are You Dense", the advocacy group driving this legislation, states that 40% of women have dense breast tissue and that 95% of these women are unaware of their breast density. The aim of this patient survey study was to determine whether state legislation for mandatory breast density reporting has altered the number of women informed about their breast density compared to states without mandatory reporting. A 19 question survey was introduced using the social media site Facebook targeting women who are health conscious. Patients were asked to answer questions about their age, personal and family history of cancer, personal and family history of genetic testing, health behaviors including tobacco and alcohol intake and exercise habits and BMI, and personal history of breast screening results and whether they had been told they had dense breasts by a health care provider. Results were recorded and data analyzed using chi square and student t test. 17,936 women visited the survey site, and 15,392 women completed the survey. Of these, 3,536 women reported to be over 40 and eligible for mammography screening. 1,997 (56%) reported that they had been informed by a health provider that they had "dense breast tissue". Among patients residing in the 21 states with mandatory reporting, 59% (1231 out of 2098 responding) reported being told they had dense breasts vs 53% (766 out of 1438) of patients residing in states without mandatory reporting. While groups advocating for mandatory reporting of breast density want to ensure that women with dense breast tissue are informed of their risk, and have access to an early breast cancer diagnosis, it is yet unclear whether this legislation impacts early cancer diagnosis or whether patients are actually being informed with increased frequency based on the legislation. Our study did not show a significant difference in the number of patients being informed of increased breast density in states with mandatory reporting. Additional studies are required to determine whether this legislation has any impact on patient awareness, uptake of additional screening, and earlier detection of breast cancer.

      <data key="d3">Background : NCCN provides guidelines for breast cancer post-therapy surveillance (clinic appointments, mammograms, and anti-hormone therapy use). The multidisciplinary breast care clinic (MDC) was designed with a specific infrastructure to serve women with state-federal safety net funding. The purpose of this study was to determine patient compliance in this population. Methods : A retrospective chart review was performed on 82 previously diagnosed breast cancer subjects seen at the MDC during 2011-13. Post-therapy surveillance compliance for clinic appointments (CA, n=82), annual mammography for subjects with one or both breasts intact (MAM, n=75), and yearly evaluation for subjects prescribed anti-hormone therapy (AHT, n=61) was assessed. Compliance was compared based on subject characteristics: age, stage, distance from home to MDC, insurance carrier, race, and ethnicity. Results : The per patient average combined compliance for all post-therapy surveillance was 87.7% at 12 months, 57% at 18 months, and 76.9% at 60 months. There were no trends in the analysis of average of CA kept based on insurance carriers. HMO participants had the highest percentage compliance at (95.0%; n= 2). After that, the ranking was as follows: 73.7% of those who are under the Breast Cancer Early Detection Program (BCEDP) (n=9), 68.6% under Cal Optima (n= 63), 68.2% straight Medicare (n= 2), and 63.1% for subjects with MediCal (n= 6). While no trend was identified for MAM by insurance carrier, the compliance was overall higher (average of 90%) when compared to CA (average of 74%) and AHT compliance (average of 87%). The overall cumulative percent compliance by test category and characteristic groups was: Conclusions: Given the perceived challenge of consistent, reliable follow up in this patient population, the results of this analysis are quite encouraging with averages for mammogram at 87%, AHT compliance of 76%, and CA at 68%. The compliance patterns discovered in this evaluation document the expectations and serve as a real-life practical, community standard. Mammography emerged as a driving component of compliance. The overall average combined compliance reduction at 18 months may be associated with possible visits to non-MDC facilities when mammography was not performed. An attempt to define outlier groups for potential infrastructure modification, based on unique group characteristics, was unsuccessful. While this may be attributed to the small n values, an alternate explanation is that the consistent infrastructure designed for a diverse, underinsured population resulted in a lack of variation.

 Introduction &amp; Objective This report highlights an unusual presentation of skin metastasis of inflammatory breast cancer that resembles a rare condition called Carcinoma en Cuirasse (CeC). CeC was first described by anatomist Alfred Velpeau in 1838 when he observed how the coalescing nodules and diffuse sclerodermoid induration found on the chest and abdomen in CeC resembled the medieval steel breastplate or a cuirasse. Case Presentation A 62-year-old female presented to the emergency department for evaluation of a palpable left breast mass and concurrent skin lesions for the past 5 months. Based on the erosion of the nipple, chest CT, as well as core needle and skin biopsy, a diagnosis of stage IV (cT4d, cN3, cM1) ER+, PR-, HER2/neu- advanced/inflammatory breast carcinoma was made. The patient underwent a 20-week course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by 25 treatments of neoadjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a total dose of 5000cGy to the left breast and the regional lymph node due to disease progression after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. She proceeded to bilateral modified radical mastectomy and bilateral lymph node involvement was found, and later disease progressed with skin involvement outside the EBRT treatment field. Additional 25 treatment of palliative radiotherapy was utilized with another 5000cGy, followed by 2 months of chemotherapy to provide better palliation and quality of life. Upon completion of therapy, a unique skin metastasis pattern was noticed. Shortly afterward the patient passed away from severe sepsis secondary to multiple wounds infected by drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by Clostridium difficile colitis. Conclusion This case shows clinical characteristics of Carcinoma en Cuirasse and provides important considerations for more research to be done to highlight the unique pattern of skin metastasis following radiation and the potential use for radiation to treat chemotherapy-resistant skin metastasis from recurrent invasive breast carcinoma.

      <data key="d3">Background: Breast cancer incidence increases in age. Unfortunately, elderly patients are often under-treated and under-diagnosed affecting their overall survival with limited availability of clinical trial data. Patients and Methods: We used data from our cancer registry and our state cancer registry to evaluate cases of breast cancer diagnosed between the years 2005 and 2010 with follow up data available to date to examine the method of diagnosis (mammogram vs. palpable abnormality), age at diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, type of surgery, receptor status, treatment received, and survival. We then were able to use our state database which contained data regarding causality of death. Based on the data available we were able to evaluate the impact of the method of diagnosis and treatment on patient mortality. Results: A total of 495 octogenerian breast cancer patients were diagnosed between 2005 and 2010. The median age at diagnosis was 85 with a range of 81-102. Out of the 495 patients 55% were diagnosed with a mammogram and 41% by palpable abnormality. The patients who presented with a palpable mass were more likely to die of breast cancer (26%) than the patients who presented with a screening abnormality (9%). The patients with a screening abnormality also had a longer survival (30.0 month) among patients who died from breast cancer as opposed to those who presented with a palpable abnormality who died from breast cancer (16.7 months). While the number of patients dying from other causes was similar (65% screened vs. palpable) the patients with palpable findings had a shorter survival (30.5 months) compared to those detected by screening (48.9 months). There was an improvement in survival among patients who presented with a palpable mass and were treated with endocrine therapy (17.3 vs 11%). This improvement did not extend to the screened population (24.3% vs 29%), although the patients who died from breast cancer had an overall longer survival (35.4 months vs 27.3 months). There was also an improvement in survival among patients who received radiation therapy in both the screened (33% vs. 22%) and palpable (22.5% vs 11.1%) groups. Only 6% of patients in the entire study received chemotherapy. Conclusion: Our data support continued use of screening mammography in patients who are at good surgical risk into their 809s. The patients who were diagnosed with symptoms fared worse than the patients who had their cancer discovered on routine imaging. There was an improvement in patients who were treated with adjuvant endocrine and radiation therapy although the rationale behind providing or excluding treatment cannot be discerned from this retrospective registry study.

      <data key="d2">Scott Delach; Giordano Caponigro</data>
      <data key="d3">Background: The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib have been established as effective treatment options for hormone receptor–positive (HR+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER2–) breast cancer. While these agents have not been evaluated head-to-head in clinical studies, they have all demonstrated significant progression-free survival improvements; however, only two of these, abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy (ET; MONARCH 2) and ribociclib plus ET (MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7), achieved significant overall survival (OS) to date prompting closer examination of how these CDK4/6 inhibitors are distinct. Preclinical studies revealed differences in how these molecules interact with various kinases. These studies indicated that ribociclib and palbociclib exhibited greater selectivity for CDK4 and CDK6 relative to other human kinases than abemaciclib. In addition, studies suggested that these molecules displayed different relative activity against their primary targets CDK4 and CDK6. Although intriguing, these latter studies either used purified proteins without the accompanying cellular context or used proliferation as a proxy for target engagement. Here, we sought to extend the body of evidence created by the prior analyses by constructing cellular model systems where the effects of each CDK4/6 inhibitor on CDK4 or CDK6 could be studied in isolation.Methods: MEL-JUSO (an NRAS mutant melanoma cell line) and MIA PaCa-2 (a KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line) cells were selected for this analysis after being identified as lacking dependence on either CDK4 or CDK6, as indicated by short hairpin RNA knockdown. Isogenic variants of each cell line lacking either CDK4 or CDK6 expression were generated by ablating CDK4 or CDK6 expression using CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing techniques and single-cell clonal selection. Levels of phosphorylated RB (phospho-RB) protein were used as a readout for target inhibition and were measured by Fast Scan phospho-RB (ppRB807/811) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for each CDK4/6 inhibitor were calculated in parental cells, as well as variant cell lines expressing only CDK4 or CDK6. Additionally, measurement of phospho-RB was performed in T47-D cells (an estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer cell line) to confirm results of prior analyses.Results: The level of phospho-RB inhibition in T47-D cells was similar to what has been described previously (Chen P, et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2016). In MEL-JUSO cells, ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib inhibited CDK4 at 11-, 22-, and 2-fold lower drug concentrations than CDK6, respectively. In MIA PaCa-2 cells, ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib inhibited CDK4 at 9-, &gt;47-, and 2-fold lower drug concentrations than CDK6, respectively. Conclusions: Consistent with prior biochemical studies and cell proliferation assays, our findings indicate that both ribociclib and abemaciclib more potently inhibit CDK4 than CDK6, whereas palbociclib has similar activity against both targets in cells. Understanding the importance of CDK4 relative to CDK6 in the etiology of breast cancer and possible implications for increased CDK4 target engagement is an emerging topic of discussion in the field. Given that CDK4 has been shown to be expressed at higher levels in breast tumor samples, and many breast cancer cell lines have demonstrated greater dependence on CDK4 vs CDK6, the differential inhibition of the CDK4/6 inhibitors may have important implications.

      <data key="d3">Fundamental to the effective clinical use of new therapeutic agents for cancer is the identification of genetic biomarkers of sensitivity as well as the identification of additional patient populations who would benefit from treatment. Here, through an unbiased functional genomics approach in a model of aggressive disease using cancer cell line spheroid cultures, we have uncovered a role for the histone acetyltransferase CREBBP as a tumour suppressor in aggressive hard to treat triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). We find that CREBBP protein expression is altered in a substantial proportion of TNBCs, as well as other solid tumours, including lung and lymphoma where CREBBP inactivating mutations are common. We found CREBBP alterations are associated with higher genomic heterogeneity and poorer patient survival in TNBCs and resulted in upregulation of the FOXM1 transcriptional network. Strikingly, treatment with clinical CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), that indirectly target FOXM1 activity, selectively impaired growth in spheroids, cell line xenografts and patient derived models from multiple tumour types with CREBBP alterations. Here we provide the pre-clinical and mechanistic rationale for assessing CREBBP alterations as a biomarker of single-agent CDK4/6 inhibitor response in a new patient population. This represents a novel synthetic lethal approach to targeting triple negative breast cancers with limited therapeutic options. Citation Format: Rachael Natrajan.

 While early detection of breast cancer (BC) has improved prognoses, there is an urgent need to improve outcomes for patients with distant metastatic disease. Higher expression of the Notch ligand JAG1 in primary BC tumors is strongly associated with lymph node metastasis and patient mortality, but causality is unclear. We show that JAG1 expression is higher in patients’ metastatic BC cells colonizing lymph nodes than in primary tumors, suggesting that tumor cells with high JAG1 are preferentially able to metastasize to lymph nodes. JAG1 expression is higher in a derivative of BC line MDA-MB-231 selected for tropism to lymph nodes (MDA231-LN) than in the parental line or derivatives with other tropisms. To determine the mechanism(s) of JAG1-mediated metastasis, we generated clonal JAG1 knockout cell lines from MDA231-LN cells with corresponding JAG1 rescue lines. We investigated the role of JAG1 in spontaneous metastasis under clinically relevant conditions by orthotopically implanting JAG1 knockout and expressing cells, resecting the primary tumor, and following long-term metastatic spread in a mouse model. Quantification of tumor cells in blood showed that survival, metastatic burden, and JAG1 expression did not correlate with the number of circulating tumor cells. Conversely, JAG1 expression drove an increase in lymph node and body-wide metastatic burden and a trend toward decreased survival. In this model metastatic cells were abundant throughout lymph vessels, suggesting lymphatics are the primarily route of dissemination. Preliminary transcriptional analysis suggests that JAG1 alters interactions with lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), potentially via VEGF signaling, leading us to examine downstream events in co-cultures of LEC with lymphatically invasive BC lines. Deciphering tumor-lymphatic endothelial signaling events may open new avenues to target BC metastasis.

      <data key="d3">Background: HER3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 3) is a member of the HER family and overexpressed in a broad range of cancer types including colorectal cancer. HER3 targeted therapies such as anti-HER3 antibodies have been investigated in clinical trials; however, no HER3-targeting therapy has been approved to date. U3-1402 is a novel antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a fully human anti-HER3 antibody (patritumab) and a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) which is conjugated via an enzymatically cleavable peptide-linker with high drug antibody ratio (DAR: 7-8 to 1). Purpose: To investigate the antitumor efficacy of U3-1402 in HER3-expressing colorectal cancer xenograft models. Material and methods: The following cell lines were used in this study; WiDr, Colo320DM, and DiFi with KRAS wild type, DLD-1, HCT15, HCT116, LoVo, SW480, and SW620 harboring KRAS mutation. The sensitivities of 9 colorectal cancer cell lines to DXd were evaluated by in vitro cell killing assay. Cells were treated with DXd at different concentrations (0.5pM to 500nM) over 144 hours, and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined. Cell surface HER3 antigen was quantified by flow cytometry. In vivo screening assay and tumor growth inhibition assay were performed in tumor xenograft models exhibiting a range of HER3 expression levels. In addition, the efficacy of U3-1402 was compared to that of parental antibody patritumab, CPT-11, control-ADC, and saline in SW620 tumor xenograft model harboring KARS mutation. All results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and statistical significance was analyzed using ANOVA with Dunnet multiple comparison. Results: In in vitro study, the range of IC50 value of DXd for each cell line was 2.16 ± 0.11 nM to 16.04 ± 0.10 nM. Most of the cell lines were sensitive to DXd. In in vivo screening assay, the maximum regression from U3-1402 was observed in the tumor xenograft model of both DiFi (high HER3 expression; KRAS wild type) and SW620 (high HER3 expression; KRAS mutation). In in vivo tumor growth inhibition assay, the antitumor efficacy was dependent on the HER3 expression level. Notably, SW620 tumor growth was significantly suppressed with U3-1402 compared with that of saline group (p Conclusions: The antitumor efficacy of U3-1402 in xenograft models was dependent on HER3 expression and did not show a clear relationship to KRAS mutation status. These results support further investigation of development strategies for U3-1402 in patients with HER3-expressing colorectal cancer.

      <data key="d3">Accumulating evidence suggests that the Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is a bona fide oncogene. These conclusions are primarily based on the positive role of SHP2 in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling in multiple systems. Because overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is one of the primary causes of BC, we investigated the potential of SHP2 targeting in this subtype of BC. We have used our recently patented SHP2 inhibitor called WGMDY (US 9,932,288) for targeting SHP2 under cell culture and in vivo conditions. We have also used the recently reported allosteric SHP2 inhibitor called SHP099 particularly in the cell culture studies. We found that HER2-positive BC cells are highly sensitive to SHP2 inhibition with WGMDY as determined by loss of viability in 2D, transformation in soft agar, and cancer stem cell properties in suspension cultures. Similar results were obtained with SHP099 albeit at a reduced rate. Analysis of protein and RNA extracts showed inhibition of the Ras-ERK and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathways by WGMDY, but SHP099 tend to activate Akt signaling. In addition, WGMDY blocked overexpression of the HER2 protein in HER2-positive BC cells. As such, we focused on WGMDY for the in vivo efficacy studies. The results showed that WGMDY induces regression of preformed tumors in a concentration dependent manner. Histopathology analyses of tumors showed induction of necrosis in treated samples. Hence, WGMDY has a promising anti-cancer effects in HER2-positive BC. Citation Format: Yehenew Agazie, Zachary Hartman.

 Background/Purpose: This study evaluates the toxicity after radiotherapy after mastectomy without reconstruction in patients irradiated to the chest wall using previously reported technique of PMERT.
 Materials/Methods: We included all women irradiated after mastectomy for not metastatic breast cancer with PMERT between 2007 and 2011 in the Department of Radiation Oncology of the Institut Curie. Previously reported technique using mostly electrons was evaluated in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Acute and late toxicities were assessed retrospectively using CTCAE v.4.0. A clinical exam was weekly performed during radiotherapy and one and three months following the completion of radiotherapy. Patients were then followed as recommended in Institut Curie guidelines (Senorif). Quantitative and qualitative data were described respectively as means and proportions. Statistical comparisons were computed using X² or Fischer’s exact test for categorical data. Recurrence free survival (RFS) was defined as the time between the end of treatment and the date of recurrence or death. Overall survival was the same but recurrences were not taken into account. Patients who did not experienced any event were censored at the date of last news.
 Results: Among the 796 women included, 51.3% had multifocal lesions, 10.1% a triple negative (TN) status and 18.8% a HER2+ positive status; 196 (24.6%) received a neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 208 (26.1 %) a systemic therapy during radiotherapy (chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy); 514 (64.6%) had at least one positive lymph node (LN). Internal mammary chain (IMC) was treated in 85.6% of cases, supraclavicular LN (L4) in 88.3% of cases, infraclavicular (L3-2-IP+/- L1) LN in 77.9% of cases and low axilla (L1) in 14.9% of cases. With a median follow up of 113 months [range : 2-164] locoregional recurrence-free survival and overall survival at 10 years were respectively 94.02 (IC95% : 92.13-98.94) and 79.84 (IC95% : 76.83-82.97). The median survival was not reached. In the long term, 29.6% of patients had telangiectasia (grade 1: 23.3%, grade 2: 5.2% Grade 3: 1.1%). Totally 279 patients (35.1%) had breast reconstruction, on average 21 months after the end of radiotherapy. Twenty-five patients (3%) had early esophageal toxicity, not exceeding the grade 1. Of these patients, 21 had had chemotherapy and all were irradiated on the lymph nodes (24 including the IMC). Irradiation of the IMC was not associated with an increased chronic lung toxicity (OR=1.03 [0.98-1.09]). There were 35 patients who developed heart disease after the end of the treatment. Of them, 30 patients had received anthracyclines (p=1.05) and 9 trastuzumab (p =1.09). Four patients developed ischemic heart disease, 3/4 irradiated on the left chest wall, all on the CMI and supra and infraclavicular LN, but all of them presented multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 to 4).
 Conclusions: Our series have shown that the PMERT using the Institut Curie technique is effective and well tolerated.

 INTRODUCTION: The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ERα) positive making endocrine therapy a mainstay for these patients. Unfortunately, resistance to endocrine therapy is a common occurrence. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme in lipid biosynthesis and is overexpressed in more aggressive and therapy-resistant tumors, including breast cancers. METHODS: The effect of the FASN inhibitor TVB-3166 on ERα expression and cell growth was characterized in tamoxifen-resistant and fulvestrant-resistant cell lines, xenografts, and patient explants. Subcellular localization of ERα was assessed using subcellular fractionations. Palmitoylation and ubiquitination of ERα were assessed by immunoprecipitation. ERα and p-eIF2α protein levels were analyzed by western blotting after treatment with TVB-3166 with or without the addition of palmitate or BAPTA. RESULTS: TVB-3166 treatment leads to a marked inhibition of proliferation in tamoxifen-resistant and fulvestrant-resistant cells compared to the parental cells. Additionally, TVB-3166 significantly inhibited tamoxifen-resistant breast tumor growth in mice and decreased proliferation of primary tumor explants compared to untreated controls. FASN inhibition significantly reduced ERα levels most prominently in endocrine resistant cells and altered its subcellular localization. Furthermore, we showed that the reduction of ERα expression upon TVB-3166 treatment is mediated through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. CONCLUSION: Our preclinical data provide evidence that FASN inhibition by TVB-3166 presents a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Further clinical development of FASN inhibitors for endocrine resistant breast cancer should be considered.

      <data key="d3">Patients with breast cancer spend significant time1, effort, and financial resources2 to combat the disease for years after their diagnosis. The large volume of healthcare tasks can cause patients to become overburdened, leading to reduced adherence with care plans and worse outcomes3. On the other hand, certain patient characteristics such as physical resilience, financial well-being, and supportive family environments increase patients9 capacity to manage care4. Assessing treatment burden and capacity when prescribing care has been applied to populations such as diabetes patients5. We are investigating this paradigm in treatment of patients with breast cancer. The goal of this preliminary study is to identify significant factors that contribute to treatment burden, capacity to manage care, and outcomes of overburden for patients with breast cancer. Through literature review, interviews with survivors, and expert panels of navigators and providers, we will develop a survey instrument given to patients at the time of diagnosis. The survey will assess patient capacity and help providers give treatment options based on attributes of the patient. Additionally, we will attempt to correlate survey results with treatment burden measures derived from electronic health record data at a population level1. With treatment personalized for patient capacity, patients should be better able to adhere to care plans leading to improved quality of life during treatment and beyond.

      <data key="d3">p53 fosters metabolic reprogramming, which restricts metabolic adaptation of tumor cells under energy stress conditions. However, modulation and directionality of underlying cascades to induce or restrict metabolism are determined by the downstream target of p53. To explore the role of p53 in tumor metabolism upon metabolic stress, we performed a microarray screen in the presence or absence of p53 under glucose starvation. We observed caspase-10 to be upregulated by p53 upon metabolic stress. Caspase-10 belongs to the class of initiator caspases and is poorly understood in terms of substrate specificities. Emerging evidences also suggest intrinsic activation of caspase-10, distinct from its homologue caspase-8. Moreover, inactivating mutations as well as downregulation of caspase-10 in several carcinomas are suggestive of its role in tumorigenesis. Thus, we investigated the function of caspase-10 as a tumor suppressor. Our results indicated that caspase-10, upregulated in a p53-dependent manner in response to metabolic stress, was activated by homodimerization-induced intrinsic activation mechanism involving Adenylate Kinase 2 and FADD. We further performed a proteomic screen to identify novel caspase-10 substrates. We observed that several anabolic enzymes are caspase-10 interacting partners. However, in vitro and in vivo assays confirmed only ATP-Citrate Lyase (ACLY) as a novel substrate of caspase-10. Cleavage of ACLY by caspase-10 abrogates enzymatic conversion of cytosolic citrate to acetyl-CoA, leading to overall decrease in nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA pool. Decrease in cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels suppress lipogenesis upon metabolic stress. Moreover, decreased levels of nuclear acetyl-CoA alter global histone acetylation. Further studies using RNAi established that alteration in histone acetylation is GCN5-dependent. Caspase-10-dependent abrogation of histone acetylation reprograms the epigenetic profile of metastatic and proliferative genes, leading to their diminished expression under metabolic stress. Concomitant suppression of both cytosolic lipogenesis and nuclear histone acetylation by caspase-10-mediated ACLY cleavage decreases proliferation capacity, migration potential and invasiveness of tumor cells. Further, studies in mouse tumor models confirmed that caspase-10 restricts tumorigenesis and metastases under metabolic stress via ACLY and GCN5. Taken together, our findings establish caspase-10 as a novel integrator of metabolism and epigenetics, by regulating acetyl-CoA levels. Hence, it functions as a tumor suppressor by disrupting lipogenesis-mediated metabolic reprogramming and GCN5-mediated epigenetic reprogramming. Citation Format: Rajni Kumari, Sanjeev Das.

      <data key="d3">The invasive progression of cancer known as metastasis remains strongly associated with morbidity and lethality. New meaningful therapeutic interventions could be derived from a better understanding of the underlying processes driving cancer cell seeding and proliferation at secondary sites. Emerging findings regarding the heterogeneity of cancer cells observed in metastases have led us to revisit concepts surrounding metastatic fitness. Novel model systems to study the markers of cancer stem cell plasticity and their evolution during metastatic growth have uncovered that dynamic and heterogeneous cancer cell populations are observed during metastatic disease progression. Heinz and colleagues studied the heterogeneity of colorectal carcinomas, where primary tumors evolve alongside an epithelium well characterized for its self-renewing stem cell population. Their work revealed a functional dynamic interplay in the organization of the metastatic lesions as they transition from stagnating to expanding nodules, wherein the heterogeneous mixture of cancer cell stem cells with more differentiated cancer cells is essential for metastatic outgrowth. Their work supports that dynamic YAP signaling enables the growth-permissive heterogeneous composition of the metastatic nodule, in contrast with growth-restricted homogeneous compositions.

      <data key="d3">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) contains a desmoplastic stroma that limits blood perfusion and thus the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and even therapeutics, creating a hypoxic microenvironment that resists nearly all forms of treatment, including immunomodulating therapy. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are the main cellular components and producers of stroma in PDAC. Interestingly, CAFs exist as functionally diverse subpopulations derived from distinct lineages, some of which can be either inflammatory (iCAF) or myofibroblastic (myCAF). While previous work has suggested a link between hypoxia and the iCAF phenotype, direct experimental evidence is lacking. In this issue of Cancer Research, Schwörer and colleagues investigate the role of hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) in maintaining fibroblast heterogeneity and promoting tumor progression in PDAC. The authors use a combination of in vitro and orthotopic techniques to identify a strong role for hypoxia in combination with tumor-derived cytokines in maintaining an iCAF phenotype highlighted by IL6 expression. The authors use an innovative in vitro system to simulate oxygen gradients and use these methods to support their assertions regarding hypoxia as a proinflammatory state. These findings suggest that HIF1α promotes the generation of iCAFs, providing novel insight into CAF heterogeneity. See related article by Schwörer et al., p. 1596.</data>

      <data key="d3">Background: We know Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive and/or Progesterone Receptor (PgR) positive tumors tend to develop more frequently in obese individuals in postmenopausal women. However, the average body size of a Japanese woman is relatively smaller than that of a Caucasian woman. There are few reports about the influence of the obesity to the character of the Japanese breast cancer women and the tendency is not clear. The aim of this study is to clarify whether the tendency is the same even in Japanese breast cancer women. Furthermore, we investigate whether HER2 expression (HER2) and Ki-67 index (Ki-67) have some relations with the height (HT), the weight (WT) and the body mass index (BMI) in Japanese breast cancer women. Methods: HT and WT of 279 Japanese women with breast cancer in Kitamurayama hospital were evaluated. The mean HT and WT of them are 153.6cm and 54.9kg. Subsequently, the women9s BMI (WT/(HT)2) was calculated. The mean BMI was 23.3. The ER and PgR were stained for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Regardless of the intensity, stained cases were defined as positive. HER2 was divided into HER2 negative (IHC score 0, +1 and/or FISH negative) or positive (IHC score +3 and/or FISH positive). Ki-67 was determined by staining with MIB-1 antibody, and the cutoff value was decided on 20%, and divided into two groups of more than 20% (Higher) and less than 20% (Lower). Then, we examined the relationship of HT, WT and BMI with ER, PgR, HER2 and Ki-67 in postmenopausal and premenopausal women. Result: In postmenopausal women, WT and BMI were significantly higher in ER positive (p=0.0230, p=0.0129). WT and BMI were also significantly higher in PgR positive (p=0.0049, p=0.0294,). There was no significant difference between HER2 positive and Her2 negative, and between Ki-67 Higher and Ki-67 Lower either. In premenopausal women, no significant association was observed in all items. Conclusion: In postmenopausal women, HT did not have the significant difference between ER (and PgR) positive and ER (and PgR) negative. However, ER (and PgR) positive were significantly higher in WT and BMI. It was thought that the obesity influences the character of the breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to less obese postmenopausal Japanese women with breast cancer, more obese postmenopausal Japanese women have a propensity for developing hormone sensitive tumors.

      <data key="d3">Background Gestational breast cancer (GBC), diagnosed during pregnancy or in the first postpartum year, is expected to rise in incidence due to increasing maternal age. GBC poses unique challenges in diagnosis and treatment as clinicians seek to provide optimal treatment for these young patients without compromising neonatal outcomes. We present our retrospective findings from the first study on gestational breast cancer in Singapore. Methods We performed a retrospective study on 88 patients with gestational breast cancer diagnosed from April 2003 to April 2017 at three centres in Singapore. Demographic details, tumour histopathological characteristics, stage, treatment and outcomes data was collected and analysed. Results Eighty-eight patients were diagnosed with GBC at a median age of 35.9 years (26-43 years). Fifty (56.8%) were diagnosed intrapartum and 38 (43.2%) were diagnosed postpartum. Seventeen (19.8%) had a family history of breast cancer but none had proven BRCA mutation. Seventeen patients (19.3%) presented with stage 1, 36 (40.9%) with stage 2, 25 (28.4%) with stage 3, 5 (5.7%) with stage 4 disease. Seventeen patients underwent termination of pregnancy (27.9% of patients diagnosed during pregnancy). Seventeen (19.3%) of patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 8 of whom received it during pregnancy. Forty-eight (54.5%) received adjuvant chemotherapy, 4 of whom received it during pregnancy. Two patients received palliative chemotherapy during pregnancy. Aside from one case of hearing impairment, there was no other documented neonatal complication for patients who received intrapartum chemotherapy. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 80% and 66%. According to the Singapore National Cancer Registry, the 5-year OS for women younger than 44 years of age was 88.9%, therefore suggesting a lower OS in patients with GBC. The 5-year and 10 year disease-free survival (DFS) of our patients was 73% and 60% respectively. Diagnosis of cancer postpartum conferred a higher risk (hazard ratio (95%CI) 1.86 (0.55, 6.28) of mortality compared to those diagnosed intrapartum. Univariate Cox proportional hazard regression model showed that nodal positivity and clinical stage were significantly associated with DFS while only clinical stage was significantly associated with OS. Race was found to affect survival with Malay patients having a lower DFS compared to Chinese patients. Conclusion GBC patients in Singapore have a lower survival rate. Diagnosis of cancer postpartum confers a higher risk of mortality. This might be due to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Malay patients have a lower survival compared to Chinese patients. Studies into genetic and social factors might shed light on how ethnicity affects survival of these patients. Citation Format: Tan QT, Wong FY, Alcantara VS, Ganguly R, Loh KW-J.

      <data key="d3">Background: Changes in bladder function are recognized effects of aging and menopause but have not generally been reported in women treated for breast cancer. We initiated a prospective trial to assess the impact of (neo) adjuvant therapy on women with early stage breast cancer. Methods: Women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer who were to initiate (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy were approached for study participation. At baseline a urinalysis, urine culture, and self assessment quality of life questionnaires were completed. The Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) assesses bladder symptoms and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) assesses the impact of bladder symptoms on quality of life. Three months after initiation of (neo)adjuvant therapy, the quality of life questionnaires were repeated. We report the results of the pretreatment questionnaires. Results: Between February and June, 2015, forty-nine women with newly diagnosed breast cancer were enrolled on study. The median age was 54 (Range 25-78); 21 were premenopausal and 28 postmenopausal. Twenty nine (59%) were treated in the adjuvant setting; 12 with chemotherapy and 17 with endocrine therapy. Twenty patients, (41%) were treated in the neoadjuvant setting with chemotherapy. Prior to initiation of therapy, " Frequent urination" was reported in 38 (65%), " Leakage related to urgency" in 5 ( 10%), " Leakage with physical activity" in 32 (55%) and "Small amounts of leakage" in 32 (55%). Bladder symptoms impacted the ability to perform household chores in 8 (16%), Physical recreation in 10 (20%), social activities in 9 (18%), and Emotional health in 5 (10%).

      <data key="d3">In the United States, 100,000 women each year are diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia (AH), significantly increasing their risk of developing breast cancer. However, only 40% of patients accept breast cancer preventive treatment, in part, due to systemic side effects. The localization of pre-cancerous cells within the ducts or lobules of the breast permits a local treatment strategy employing the innate mammary ducts. This expansive tree-like structure extends throughout the entire breast and may serve as a conduit for local delivery of therapeutics, thereby minimizing side effects associated with current preventive treatment strategies. This study examines how lipophilicity influences diffusion through porcine tissue using a model hydrophilic dye, Sulforhodamine B (SRB), and a model lipophilic dye, Nile Red (NR). Porcine nipple or skin tissue was positioned in a Franz diffusion cell and the formulations were applied topically. With equivalent dye concentrations applied to the donor surface, we noted no significant difference in total dye permeation when comparing diffusion through skin versus nipple tissue or when comparing SRB versus NR after 48 hours. However, the diffusion coefficient for both NR and SRB through the nipple was almost 700-fold greater compared to through the skin indicating improved drug delivery via the nipple. Additionally, after 48 hours there was significantly higher retention of SRB in the nipple and skin compared to NR. When we further looked at the distribution of each dye within the nipple using fluorescence microscopy, we saw a distinction in the localization of each dye. Fluorescence micrographs show that lipophilic NR is retained within the ducts while the hydrophilic SRB diffuses throughout the entire tissue section, suggesting that hydrophobicity impacts the ability of molecules to diffuse from the duct into the surrounding tissue. This suggests that lipophilic carriers may be effective for delivery of cancer therapeutics or preventative agents targeting the mammary ducts, where AH is localized.

      <data key="d3">Introduction Cancer survivorship is the process of living through and beyond cancer; a key part is how a patient copes with their diagnosis. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy of women worldwide and is known to be a severe stressor. Research has determined that the coping strategies used by women with breast cancer are vital to adjustment to their disease. Immediate breast reconstruction at the time of mastectomy with preservation of the breast form has been shown to be a positive influence on breast cancer patients however there are currently no studies to show whether breast reconstruction changes mechanisms of coping for such patients. The aim of this study, therefore, was to conduct a prospective cohort study to determine whether immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy changes the way women with breast cancer cope with their diagnosis, compared to those who have mastectomy alone. Method A standardised questionnaire, the Brief Cope Scale was sent to two cohorts of patients who had a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction or mastectomy alone over an 11 year period 2003 to 2014 in Shropshire, England. It is a 28-point item with a four point Likert scale, which measures 14 different coping mechanisms: self-distraction, active coping, denial, substance use, use of emotional support, use of instrumental support, behavioral disengagement, venting, positive reframing, planning humour, acceptance, religion and self-blame. The inclusion criteria for this study was all woman who had mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction in Shropshire between 2003 and 2014 for either Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or breast cancer which was node negative (cohort 1). The principle exclusion criteria were: men, node positive cancer, prophylactic mastectomy and breast reconstruction. Each index patient was matched for year of diagnosis, adjuvant therapy and age to woman who had mastectomy alone for DCIS or breast cancer which was node negative (cohort 2). An anonymous questionnaire was sent out to all patients identified who were still living, with a reminder letter at six weeks. Results Questionnaires were sent to a total of 234 patients; 117 patients in each cohort. Preliminary results indicate a response rate of 46%, with 60 responses from reconstruction cohort and 48 from mastectomy. The mean age was 50, with range 29 to 70 for reconstruction cohort, and the mean age of mastectomy cohort was 52, with range 32 to 70. Common coping styles for the reconstruction cohort were acceptance, active coping and use of emotional support. Common coping styles for mastectomy cohort were acceptance, use of emotional support and positive reframing. Significantly more patients from the reconstruction cohort coped by active coping (T value 1.88 at P value 0.02). Significantly less patients coped by active venting in reconstructive cohort compared to mastectomy cohort; (T value 1.91 at P value 0.03). Conclusion Breast reconstruction alters coping mechanisms in breast cancer patients allowing less venting coping style and more active coping. Understanding how breast surgery changes coping mechanisms allows clinicians to understand cancer survivorship in breast cancer patients and helps to provide needed support.

 The VIOLA Study is a Clinical Utility Study designed to investigate the useability of Melody®, a tear-based screening assay for breast cancer developed and validated by Namida Lab, Inc., a high complexity CLIA certified lab. It is well established that disparities exist in breast health, preventative care, and screening mammography. Namida Lab believes in the potential of Melody® to be a tool that bridges the gap between underserved populations and positive health outcomes. As such, Namida Lab, Inc. is partnering with federally qualified health centers and large employers to evaluate the clinical utility of Melody®. Melody® consists of two parts: tear sample collection and clinical lab assay. Participants will have a tear sample collected at a study site. The clinical lab assay, Melody®, will be performed at Namida Lab, Inc. The results of the Melody® assay will be returned to the site clinician to be discussed with the participant. The administration of Melody® does not require additional appointments or trips and can be done by any member of a medical team. A minimum participation of 205 women who are 40 to 74 years of age, at average risk for developing breast cancer, asymptomatic, and have no concerns or breast abnormalities. To date 28 participants have been enrolled in the study. Study enrollment and eConsent will be conducted through our mobile application. Each participant will be required to take an enrollment survey that collects information on race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. Participant's addresses will be obtained as part of the requisition process for the CLIA lab, from which information on geographic location can be obtained. In addition to the factors listed above, the enrollment survey also collects information on status and type of health insurance, reproductive health, breast health knowledge, prior screening history, and family and personal history of cancer The exit survey has been designed to collect information on the participant experience with Melody® and comprehension of the Melody® results relayed through their site clinician. In addition, information is collected on participant''s intention to schedule/participate in future screening mammograms and/or change in intention to participate in a previously scheduled screening mammogram. Primary endpoint: The VIOLA Study is designed to assess how incorporating Melody® into a primary care provider setting affects participation and confidence in the current breast health continuum of care. Secondary endpoint: Quantifying the relationship between Melody® and increased participation in breast health care offers the clinical utility evidence required for adoption into the Standard of Care.

      <data key="d3">Background Patients with cancer and comorbidities have been found to have poorer survival since they may be unable to receive or complete treatments. It is not clear if comorbid conditions impact survival of patients in all stages of disease and all ER/PR/HER2 subtypes. Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine how the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) affected the risk of mortality of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) within each stage of disease. Methods We accessed 22,503 cases of TNBC and documented CCI from the California Cancer Registry 2000-2015. The CCI is a weighted index based on the presence of certain comorbid conditions twelve months prior through six months following the cancer diagnosis and weighted by the severity of those conditions. A score of 0 is interpreted as no significant comorbidity burden and scores of 3 or more are generally interpreted as a high comorbidity burden. Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis and the Log Rank test were used to compare differences in breast cancer specific survival between patients with a CCI of 1, 2 or higher (2+) versus a CCI of 0. Cox Regression Analysis was used to estimate risk of mortality of CCI after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, grade, and treatment. Analyses were conducted separately for each stage. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Results There 16,664 (74.1%) cases with a CCI of 0; 3,915 (17.4%) with a CCI of 1; 1,055 (4.7%) had a CCI of 2, and the remaining 869 (3.9%) cases of TNBC had a CCI of 3 or higher. Unadjusted survival analysis indicated that for stages 2 and 3, there was increased survival with decreasing CCI score. For stages 1 and 4, survival was only better for patients with a CCI of 0 versus a CCI of 2+. Cox regression analysis indicated that the CCI made no difference in risk of mortality for patients with stage 1 disease. Patients with a CCI of 2+ had an increased risk of mortality when compared with a CCI of 0 for stage 2 (HR = 1.48, CI: 1.25-1.77), stage 3 (HR=1.25, CI: 1.03-1.52) and stage 4 (HR = 1.53; CI: 1.22-1.92). Conclusion Comorbidity as measured by the CCI does not increase the risk of mortality for patients with stage 1 TNBC and only increases risk of mortality in higher stages for patients with a CCI score of 2 or higher.

      <data key="d3">Background Women undergoing lumpectomy for invasive breast cancer typically receive radiotherapy (RT) to reduce risk of recurrence. Previous studies have reported disparities in the utilization of RT by race, socioeconomic status (SES), and age. In this study, we evaluate whether various sociodemographic factors are associated with use of RT in the different regions of California. Methods Utilizing data from the California Cancer Registry, the authors identified cases of women whose first primary invasive breast cancer was diagnosed between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2012, whose primary surgery was breast conserving surgery, and for whom information was complete (n = 71,767). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine whether demographic factors (SES, race, payer status, age) were significantly associated with use of RT following lumpectomy (p Results In three out of eight regions in California, black race was associated with decreased odds of RT use (San Francisco, OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.68-0.92; Desert Sierra, OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.58-0.90; Los Angeles, OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.70-0.87). In Sacramento and Los Angeles regions, lower socioeconomic status was associated with declined odds of RT use. Age (70 years or older) was also associated with lower likelihood of RT use across all regions. Conclusions Even after accounting for payer status, racial and socioeconomic disparities persist in the use of RT. These disparities, previously documented in the time period of 2000-2007, have not disappeared. Hispanic race was not shown to be associated with decreased odds of RT use in Los Angeles, contrary to the results of a previous study. Women aged 70 years or older are less likely to receive RT.

      <data key="d3">Over the last 15 years, numerous self-report health status measures have appeared in the literature. An important parallel development has been the development of numerous strategies for assessing change in health status over time. The purpose of this article is to summarize and critique the more common design and analytic strategies for assessing the meaningfulness of change over time. Five commonly reported designs are presented, critiqued, and depicted using examples from the literature. Methods for analyzing results are reviewed and illustrated using two data sets. Insights into comparing competing health status measures are provided. In summary, the article suggests that some designs and analytic strategies are more adept than others at assessing change and that these methods should be considered when planning sensitivity-to-change studies.</data>

      <data key="d3">Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDA) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in Japan. Recently, new standard chemotherapies for PDA have been developed, but they are still largely unsatisfactory. Therefore, development of new treatment options has been required to improve the outcomes of patients with PDA. To break through this situation, blocking one of inhibitory immune checkpoints, Programmed death-1 (PD-1) /Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway is considered to be a hopeful candidate for new treatment strategies for PDA. In this context, for the future combination therapy of anticancer agents and immune check point inhibitors, we investigated how anticancer agents influence the expression of PD-L1 on pancreatic cancer cell lines. Additionally we analyzed the molecular mechanism by which PD-L1 expression on the pancreatic cancer cell lines are regulated. Methods: Human PDA cell lines MIA PaCA-2, AsPC-1 and murine PDA cell line Pan02 were used in this study. These cells were adjusted to 1.0 × 105 / ml and incubated with anticancer agents (i.e. gemcitabine, paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil) at 37°C for 24-72h. Then, the expression level of PD-L1 was determined using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. For the blocking experiment of the JAK/STAT pathway, AG490 was used as a blocking agent. After 48h incubation of AsPC-1 cells at 37°C, cells were treated with various concentration of AG490 for 1h. Cells were stimulated with 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel and gemcitabine, and then incubated in the presence or absence of AG490 for an additional 6-48h. The expression of PD-L1 was analyzed using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Stat1 and phospho-Stat1 protein were analyzed by western blotting. Results: In AsPC-1, MIA PaCA-2 and Pan02, the expression of PD-L1 was enhanced with all three anticancer agents in a concentration dependent manner. The phosphorylation of STAT1 and the increase of total STAT1 was observed in AsPC-1 when stimulated by each anticancer agents. After the treatment of JAK/STAT inhibitor, the phosphorylation of STAT1 was attenuated, and the PD-L1 upregulation induced by anticancer agents was cancelled in a concentration dependent manner. Conclusion: The stimulation of anticancer agents leads to an enhancement of PD-L1 expression on PDA cell lines. The JAK/STAT pathway is reported to be involved in IFN-γ mediated PD-L1 upregulation in lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. In the present study, the phosphorylation of Stat1 and the expression of total Stat1 were enhanced after the anticancer agents treatment. Moreover, JAK/STAT inhibitor attenuated anticancer agents-induced PD-L1 expression. Taken together, the JAK/STAT pathway may be responsible for the anticancer agents mediated PD-L1 transcription.

 Background: To review the settings and outcomes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) interventions for breast cancer survivors, and to explore the feasibility of prescribing exercise for breast cancer survivors. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted for studies published up to May 31, 2020. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials of HIIT intervention in breast cancer survivors. Studies were grouped by whether the intervention was conducted during or after breast cancer treatment, and intervention methods and outcomes were reviewed within each group. Results: Twenty-six studies were identified, and 13 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Intervention was conducted during treatment in 8 studies, and after treatment in 5. Intervention duration ranged from 3 to 16 weeks, with 2 or 3 sessions per week, for a total of 9 to 36 sessions. All interventions were supervised; 12 were lab-based, and 1 was community-based. One of most promising outcomes was improvement of cardiorespiratory fitness by HIIT. Conclusion: This review found that all studies on HIIT for breast cancer survivors investigated lab-based, supervised interventions, but not home-based or unsupervised. HIIT is a time-efficient method for increasing cardiovascular function in breast cancer survivors, but further research is necessary to determine its effects on other outcomes.

 There is a general consensus that the devastating effect of malignant breast cancers (MBCs) is due in part to the ability of breast tumors to exploit host immune functions by subverting normal mechanisms of immunosurveillance. For example, while immunotherapies based on immune checkpoint inhibition in lymphocytes have been associated with better prognosis in other cancers, the efficacy in breast cancer has been limited. We focus here on activating biochemical pathways in antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) that are otherwise immunosuppressive to stimulate the activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes through a novel mechanism. To this end, we recently discovered using an immune-competent mouse model of MBC that breast cancer cells exploit adaptive immune cells such as DCs that express CHRNA7, the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Based on the importance of the CHRNA7 signaling pathway in the control of normal inflammation in macrophages in general, we show here that CHRNA7 stimulation in DCs leads to an activation of lymphocytes associated with a reduction in MBC. Specifically, mice lacking the CHRNA7 gene have (a) decreased survival, (b) increased tumor growth kinetics, (c) immunophenotyping revealed a reduction in the “cancer-permissive” phenotype in CHRNA7 KO mice, and (d), a commensurate reduction in T cell proliferation. Based on these mechanistic proof of principle studies, we demonstrate that in contrast to the loss of CHRNA7 in KO, pharmacological activation of CHRNA7 with AR-R17779 has the opposite effect by stimulating DCs to activate the adaptive immune response which leads to tumor progression and increased survival. These findings demonstrate the preclinical potential of AR-R17779 as a clinically relevant approach to stimulate the adaptive immune system through a novel pathway that has not been examined to date, and with a small molecule drug that is stable, specific and well-tolerated.

      <data key="d2">M Lambe; I Fredriksson; ALV Johansson</data>
      <data key="d3">Background: A small, but not negligible, proportion of breast cancers in young women are detected in association with childbearing. While pregnancy usually is a period of intense medical observation, signs and symptoms of a malignancy may be overlooked or misinterpreted as pregnancy-related, resulting in diagnostic and treatment delays. Also, a delayed diagnosis in pregnant women has been suggested as a reason for the more advanced disease and poorer outcomes in women with pregnancy-associated breast cancer. Material and Methods: For the purpose of the present study, pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) was defined as an invasive breast tumor diagnosed during pregnancy and up to two years post-delivery (non-PABC cases were diagnosed outside this time window, or nulliparous). Based on a systematic review of medical records for women aged 15-44 years at diagnosis with PABC and non-PABC identified in Swedish health care registers, chart information was retrieved by trained nurses for a total of 570 women (285 PABC women and 285 age and hospital matched non-PABC women) treated at 11 hospitals across Sweden between 1992 and 2009. Median waiting times from initial signs or symptoms in days to start of treatment, and time periods within, were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the logrank test for the Kaplan-Meier curves. Dates on first symptoms were available for 122 matched PABC/non-PABC pairs, in total 244 patients. Full dates to assess and compare times between first health care contact – diagnosis – start of treatment, were available for 246 PABC/non-PABC pairs, in total 492 women. Objective: To examine and compare lengths of several defined waiting times within the time period from initial symptoms to start of treatment in women diagnosed with PABC and non-PABC. Results: Patient delay-time between first symptom and first point of contact with health care provider. Median time between first symptoms and first contact with health care was 36 days and 45 days for women with PABC and non-PABC, respectively (logrank test p-value 0.48). Time between first health care contact and diagnosis Median time between first contact and diagnosis was 7 days for both PABC and non-PABC women (logrank test p-value 0.16). Time between diagnosis and start of treatment The median waiting time from date of diagnosis to initiation of treatment was shorter in women with PABC (22 days) compared to non-PABC women (26 days) (logrank test p-value 0.14). Time between first contact and start of treatment The median delay of start of treatment from first contact with a health care provider was 34 days in PABC women and 37 days in non-PABC women. (logrank test p-value 0.14). Conclusions: Patients9 delay and the time between first contact with health care and start of treatment was shorter in women with PABC compared to non-PABC. Taken together, the present results do not support the notion that diagnostic and treatment delays are more common in women diagnosed with breast cancer during or shortly after pregnancy.

 The ability to efficiently and accurately risk stratify women can lead to improved risk-reduction measures. Actionable risk thresholds for both screening and risk-reduction guidance exist; however, despite several clinical risk models currently in existence, the utilization of such models is underwhelming. We have developed and validated an abridged clinical risk model, COSMO (Clinical pOlygenic denSity faMily mOdel), incorporating three of the most relevant epidemiological risk factors associated with sporadic and familial breast cancer in a format that is designed for “ease of use”. Polygenic risk is recognized as a promising epidemiological risk factor however, its value is greater when integrated with other phenotypic risk factors including 1st and 2nd family history, breast density menopausal status, BMI and age. We used 200,009 active UK Biobank (UKB) members who were female, genetically Caucasian, had SNP data for 313 breast cancer associated variants and aged 40 to 69 years at baseline assessment date. We used age and date of baseline assessment to calculate censoring age for those who had died before completing 5 years of follow-up and to determine the date at which 5 years of follow-up was completed for the others. We used both self-reported and linked cancer registry data (ICD9 code 174 or ICD10 code C50) to determine the earliest diagnosis of invasive breast cancer for each affected woman. In terms of discrimination, COSMO (AUC=0.651; 95% CI 0.642, 0.661) performed better than the Gail model (AUC=0.567; 95% CI=0.557, 0.567); P value for difference &lt;0.0001. Overall calibration showed the number of breast cancers expected using COSMO was slightly higher than the number observed (SIR=0.94; 95% CI=0.91, 0.97), while for the Gail model, the number of breast cancers was lower than the number observed (SIR=1.07; 95% CI=1.04, 1.11). The modest over estimation may be explained by the “healthy volunteer” selection bias of the UKB. Importantly, COSMO significantly improved predicted risk classification of women compared to the Gail when stratified according to actionable thresholds. (Table) Limitations to the validation include the lack of mammographic breast density data in the UKB—a critical factor in COSMO. To this end, we have an ongoing validation in a Nurses’ Health Study population (1,269 cases and 1,812 controls) that includes breast density data. Ongoing model comparison studies will confirm the equivalence of COSMO to standard clinical models. If performance is equivalent, COSMO has an advantage in clinical implementation because the abridged model can be less time consuming to implement in a general practice or screening clinic setting due to the truncated pedigree. Furthermore, as multiethnic cohort data access continues to improve, the epidemiological components can be recalibrated for application across any ethnicity. COSMO integrates the most impactful epidemiological risk factors, is well calibrated for the general population and provides improved discrimination over a standard risk model. General population risk assessment like COSMO can lead to the identification of more women who would benefit from clinical intervention based on current risk-reduction guidelines. Beyond that, incidental by products of a general population risk assessment include promoting breast cancer awareness, empowering women to understand their own risk, and encouraging all women to consider their lifestyle habits.

 Pharmacological Strategies to Target Circadian Clock Genes in TNBC Yuanzhong Pan, Priya Jayachandran, Evanthia T. Roussos Torres, Steve A.

Our recent analysis of clinical data showed that circadian clock genes (including positive regulators BMAL1 and CLOCK, and negative regulators CRYs, PERs, and REV-ERBs) play important roles in breast cancer, and most prominently in TNBC. We have also shown in other cancer types that cells with a mesenchymal signature and stem-cell like state rely on BMAL1/CLOCK activity to support proliferation. BMAL1 and CLOCK are transcription factors that have remained “undruggable” to date. Alternatively, our lab developed small molecule compounds that target the negative regulators CRY, REV-ERB and CK2. We are therefore prompted to study if the clock genes can serve as a therapeutic target in TNBC using our small molecules that target clock regulators in TNBC. In addition, BMAL1 and CLOCK require ubiquitin E3 ligases and proteasomes for their transcriptional function, thus we hypothesize proteosome inhibitors may provide synergy to improve response to our novel clock-based therapeutics. Methods: We first used shRNA-mediated gene knockdown (KD) to disrupt the core circadian clock regulator BMAL1 and CLOCK in a panel of TNBC cell lines across different molecular subtypes (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, HCC70, HCC1143, BT549, Hs578T). After KD, cell proliferation was quantified using CellTiter-Glo. We then tested our small molecule compounds SHP656—that stabilizes CRY, SR29065 and derivatives—that agonizes REV-ERB, and GO289—an inhibitor of CK2 that stabilizes PER. Based on our knowledge of the clock regulators, we tested drug synergy between SHP1705 and proteasome inhibitors MG132 and Carfilzomib across a range of concentrations. RNA-seq of cells treated with either single drug or drug combination were performed to study the mechanism of the synergistic effect. Results: A subset of the tested TNBC cell lines showed significantly impaired proliferation after BMAL1 or CLOCK KD. All cells in the mesenchymal-like molecular subtype responded to BMAL1/CLOCK KD, which is consistent with our previous data in other cancer types. It also confirmed BMAL1 and CLOCK have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets for mesenchymal-like TNBC. We then tested the clock compounds in our TNBC panel. We found SR29065 and GO289 both inhibit cancer cell proliferation at a clinically relevant EC50. Combination of our novel small molecule SHP1705 with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 and carfilzomib, demonstrated significant synergistic effects in vitro. In order to understand the mechanism of the synergistic effect between clock compounds and proteasome inhibitors, we performed RNA-seq on single drug and combo-treated cells. Differential expression analysis revealed that over two-thousand genes are specifically changed in the combo group. GO analysis showed that these genes are enriched in MYC target genes. Because MYC is also, like BMAL1 and CLOCK, a E-box binding transcription factor, this result implies that the mechanism driving synergy may be due to a disruption of E-box-dependent transcription. Conclusions: Here we showed that the core circadian clock regulator BMAL1 and CLOCK are potential therapeutic targets in mesenchymal-like TNBCs. Using REV-ERB agonists and CK2 inhibitors to target BMAL1/CLOCK transcription activity, we can achieve compound EC50s in single-micromolar range. In vivo experiments in murine models of TNBC are underway to determine the efficacy of single agent and combination therapy with proteosome inhibitors. Given the recently established safety of CRY stabilizers there is great potential for translation of these findings to clinical trials in patients with TNBC.

      <data key="d3">Clinical trials offer breast cancer patients access to the most innovative treatments, high levels of care and hope for a better future. Yet, fewer than 5% of individuals with breast cancer participate in clinical trials nationally. Education is commonly identified as a target for intervention to increase rates of participation. In late 2015, the Cancer Support Community (CSC) conducted an online survey assessing cancer clinical trials to inform development of an educational program aimed to increase clinical trial awareness and participation. Results from this survey highlighting the experiences, beliefs, and preferences of breast cancer patients are reported here. 239 individuals with breast cancer (47.2% of CSC9s national online survey of cancer patients) responded to survey questions assessing their experiences, knowledge, beliefs, and preferences about cancer clinical trials. Most respondents were female (99.6%), Caucasian (84.9%), and averaged 59.6 years old (s.d. =9.7). 21.4% were diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, and 22.4% had experienced a recurrence. 45% were currently receiving treatment and 75.2% were in remission. Nearly all (97.5%) had health insurance. 106 received treatment at an academic or comprehensive cancer center. Most (87.5%) had heard of clinical trials pre-cancer, however, there was a wide range of beliefs about the purpose and potential benefits of and barriers to trial participation. While 35.8% had participated in trials, 57.9% had never considered participating in a clinical trial. 53.6% had discussed clinical trials with their healthcare team during treatment. Notably one quarter reported not discussing this at all. Of those having this discussion, 59.2% reported discussions were initiated by the physician, 13.6% by nurse or other healthcare provider, and 17.6% by the patient.During this discussion, only 19% felt that their goals and concerns related to clinical trial participation were meaningfully addressed. Not surprisingly, 95.9% reported more time with their doctors to discuss clinical trials would be “somewhat” or “very” helpful for aiding decision-making. Respondents reported decision-making tools and resources that would be helpful to them. 97.4% reported that a website which included clinical trial information would be “somewhat” or “very helpful” in identifying clinical trials or aiding decision-making, yet such a resource was shared with only 27.0%. 70.5% reported that speaking directly with another patient who had participated in a clinical trial would be helpful; yet this was only offered to 8.8% of patients. Based on these findings CSC with partner organizations is developing a series of products and programs to educate individuals who may be eligible for clinical trials. The survey data yields insight into the contents of a successful education and support program around clinical trials and highlights the necessity to provide a comprehensive program that addresses patient preferences for more time to discuss clinical trials with the oncology team and with other patients who had elected to participate in a clinical trial.

      <data key="d3">Introduction Scalp cooling during chemotherapy infusion to mitigate hair loss for breast cancer patients is becoming popular in European and North American countries. But there is little prospective data regarding hair recovery after chemotherapy with scalp cooling. We reported on the results of hair loss prevention with scalp cooling during (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines and/or taxanes for 122 Japanese breast cancer patients at the 2018 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Now we report on the prospective data of hair recovery of our 122 patients. Patients and Methods One hundred and twenty two Japanese breast cancer female patients who completed planned (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy used Paxman Scalp Cooling System for alopecia prevention and were evaluable for hair loss prevention in our prospective study. The scalp cooling was done 30 minutes prior to and during and 90 minutes after each chemotherapy infusion. We evaluated their hair recovery 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 months after completion of the chemotherapy. We took photographs of the heads of the patients from 5 directions, namely front, back, both sides, and top and asked the patients about the use of a wig or hat to conceal the hair loss using a questionnaire at the times mentioned above. Primary outcomes were grades of alopecia judged by two investigators (defined as Grade 0: 0% of hair loss, G1: 1~25 %, G2: 26~50%, G3: &gt; 50%)(objective grade) and patients9 answers to the questionnaire (defined as Grade 0: not at all, G1: sometimes, G2: almost always)(subjective grade). Among 122 patients 79 completed scalp cooling during the whole planned chemotherapy cycles, but 43 discontinued it mostly after the first cycle due to several reasons. We compared the objective and subjective grades of hair loss between the patients who had completed the scalp cooling (79 patients: Group A) and those who had discontinued it (43 patients: Group B). Results Objective grades 1 month after completion of the chemotherapy were Grade 0 in 6 patients (4.9 %), G1 in 13, G2 in 29, and G3 in 74, and subjective grades at 1 month were Grade 0 in 3 patients (2.5 %), G1 in 13, G2 in 105, and unknown in 1. The changes over time in objective grades were as follows; 4 months: G0 55 (47.0 %), G1 52, G2 9, G3 1, unknown 5, 7 months: G0 99 (85.3 %), G1 15, G2 1, G3 1, unknown 6, 10 months: G0 105 (89.7 %), G1 10, G2 1, G3 1, unknown 5, 13 months: G0 104 (92.0 %), G1 7, G2 1, G3 1, unknown 9. On the other hand, the changes in subjective grades were as follows; 4 months: G0 12 (10.3 %), G1 29, G2 76, unknown 5, 7 months: G0 53 (45.7 %), G1 22, G2 41, unknown 6, 10 months: G0 80 (68.4 %), G1 15, G2 22, unknown 5, 13 months: G0 93 (82.3%), G1 7, G2 13, unknown 9. When we compared Group A with Group B, the rates of objective G0 were statistically significantly higher in Group A than Group B, at 4, 10, and 13 months (4 months: 55.7% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.010, 10 months: 96.1% vs. 78.0%, P = 0.006, 13 months: 97.3% vs. 81.6%, P = 0.011) and the rate of subjective G0 was also statistically significantly higher in Group A than Group B at 7 months (53.2 % vs. 30.8 %, P = 0.022). When we restricted the data to those with objective Grade 3 at 1 month, Group A showed tendency of faster hair recovery in the objective grades than Group B. Conclusion It is concluded that scalp cooling during chemotherapy infusion for Japanese breast cancer patients made their hair recovery faster.

 Clinical Significance: Despite initial response to therapies, patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have the highest risk of metastatic relapse within 5 years of diagnosis. There is an urgent need for better treatments for this deadly disease. To this end, understanding the molecular drivers can reveal novel therapeutic targets. Background: The TNBC oncogenic program is known to be driven by MYC. MYC expression is regulated by bromodomain proteins and several bromodomain inhibitors such as JQ1 have proven effective at inhibiting MYC expression. However, resistance can occur rapidly upon activation of alternative cell survival mechanisms, such as autophagy. TNBC is noted for its elevated basal autophagy. Interestingly, publicly available datasets show that ULK3, an initial effector of the autophagy program, is upregulated in TNBC patients while the opposite is observed for the classical autophagy initiator ULK1. Moreover, TNBC patients with low ULK3 expression levels tend to achieve longer relapse free survival (RFS) than higher expression cohort, in opposition to ULK1. Importantly, ULK3 has not been investigated to date in regulating TNBC cell intrinsic autophagy and no drugs exist that can inhibit ULK3. Methods and Results: Given the importance of MYC and ULK3 in TNBC progression, our team developed a novel class of small molecules, namely dual BRD4/ULK3 inhibitors, that are superior to JQ1 alone in limiting TNBC viability. In vitro data demonstrate that TNBC cells are more sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of the dual inhibitors compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Further investigation through western blot analysis confirms the effectiveness of these novel dual inhibitors in abrogating MYC expression overtime, and completely blocking the autophagy program (measured by downstream ULK3, ULK1, LC3B, p62 protein levels), resulting in cell death. Interestingly, the human cell line SUM159R, that is resistant to BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 and cross-resistant to standard chemotherapeutics (doxorubicin) is also highly sensitive to our dual inhibitors, implying their potential use for the treatment of refractory TNBC disease. Excitingly, and for the first time, using a genetic silencing approach (shULK3 in SUM159), we demonstrated that ULK3 is critical for TNBC autophagy and cell survival. As a proof of concept, we reproduced the same genetic silencing experiment in a different cell line, namely WM1366-LC3BmCherry-GFP, an LC3B conveniently engineered system used to visualize proper autophagosome formation and material degradation through autophagy. We verified that both genetic ablation and pharmacologic inhibition of ULK3 are strategies that lead to cancer cell death. Conclusions: In conclusion, we 1) characterized a novel class of dual BRD4/kinase compounds, capable of inhibiting BRD4 activity and autophagy, and superior to the BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1. 2) showed that ULK3 is over-expressed in TNBC. 3) demonstrated that silencing ULK3 blocks autophagy in TNBC cell lines and results in significantly lower cell viability. 4) found that our dual inhibitors present a double bind for TNBC cells that results in increased cytotoxicity and potentially will be useful for the treatment of resistant TNBC. Clinically, we also posit that our dual inhibitors could be easily administered as a single agent, avoiding the potential complication of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics associated with administering multiple therapies.

      <data key="d3">BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors report many symptoms post treatment. However, longitudinal data, including pre-treatment measures, are scarce making it difficult to accurately attribute symptoms, as patients experience many changes; hormonal fluctuation, chemotherapy, additive endocrine therapy. Therefore, we undertook this longitudinal study to distinguish the impact of these different treatments along the survivorship time course, starting with time at diagnosis. METHODS: Female, breast cancer survivors completed symptom questionnaires (Qx) pre-treatment (pre-tx), at 6-months follow-up (during-tx) and 12-months (post-tx) follow-up. Women rated symptoms in the past week as not at all, a little bit, somewhat, quite a bit, and very much. Symptoms included, hot flashes, vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse, loss of interest in intercourse, weight gain, dizziness, vomiting diarrhea, headaches, abdominal bloating, breast sensitivity, mood swings, irritability, and joint pain. Additional measures included view of overall health, overall pain in the past month, and average fatigue in the past week. Chi-square tests were conducted across time points and stratified by menopausal status and type of treatment. Symptom changes from baseline, clustered by subject, were entered into a generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. RESULTS: Of the 237 breast cancer survivors (median pre-tx age: 53 years, range: 24-70), who completed the pre-tx Qx, 112 completed the 6-month Qx and 95 completed the 12-month Qx. Women reported an increase in hot flashes from pre-tx to 6-months (p CONCLUSIONS: Several symptoms thought to be related to treatment may actually be present at time of diagnosis and many treatment-related symptoms appear to decrease by 12-months. Severity appears to be modified by menopausal status and type of treatment. Our results give crucial insight for the development of effective symptom-based management and intervention along the treatment time course.

      <data key="d3">M2698 is a selective, ATP-competitive dual inhibitor of p70S6K and Akt1/3 that is being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in cancer patients. The dual nature of M2698 may result in improved clinical efficacy by blocking the increased AKT activity in a compensatory feedback loop induced by PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathway inhibition. In previous preclinical studies, M2698 was shown to have potent anti-proliferative activity in vitro, and inhibit tumor growth in some xenograft models in vivo. The current study examined the effects of M2698 on cell proliferation in a panel of 13 gastric cancer cell lines, as gastric cancers often harbor mutations in PAM pathway genes that deregulate this signalling pathway. Cells were treated with M2698 at a range of concentrations and proliferation was evaluated at least twice using the WST-8 cell proliferation assay kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc. Japan). Two cell lines, HGC-27 and IM95m, were particularly sensitive to M2698 (50% growth inhibition concentration [GI50] 84 and 160 nM, respectively). The GI50 values for all other cell lines were &gt;10-fold higher. Although HGC-27 and IM95m each carry a PIK3CA hotspot point mutation, the presence of an activating PI3K pathway mutation was not the sole determinant of sensitivity, as a third PIK3CA mutant cell line, MKN1, was far less sensitive to M2698 (GI50 9.0 uM). Western blot analysis of pharmacodynamic biomarkers showed that M2698 (1 uM) blocked the PAM pathway in both sensitive and resistant cell lines, inhibiting phospho[p]‐S6 and p‐PRAS40, despite increased p‐Akt. Some biomarkers from the PAM pathway and other signaling pathways appeared to be associated with sensitivity to M2698, but these candidate biomarkers need to be validated in a larger panel of cell lines. Treatment of HGC-27-tumor-bearing mice with M2698 (10, 20, 30 mg/kg/day) for 14 days resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition (80.2-98.6%) at Day 29 compared to treatment with vehicle (p Citation Format: Shota Fukuoka, Takashi Kojima, Yoshikatsu Koga, Mayumi Yamauchi, Masahiro Yasunaga, Yasuhiro Matsumura, Toshihiko Doi, Takayuki Yoshino, Toshio Kuronita, Anderson Clark, Brian Elenbaas, Atsuhi Ohtsu.

      <data key="d3">In this issue of Cancer Research, Zhou and colleagues investigate the role of acute kidney injury (AKI) and AKI-associated systemic inflammation in the development of kidney cancer. They demonstrate a positive association between the formation of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and AKI induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury in genetically modified mice. In parallel with the emergence of kidney tumors, mice with ischemic injury develop systemic inflammation associated with tissue infiltration by neutrophils and fibroblasts and upregulated expression of several inflammatory factors, with CXCL1 displaying the highest levels of upregulation. Accordingly, blockade of CXCL1-mediated signaling inhibited the emergence of kidney tumors in mice subjected to ischemic kidney injury. The study provides evidence for a new experimental approach to prevent the formation of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and reduce kidney cancer incidence through modulation of the AKI-induced inflammatory response using inhibitors of CXC/CXCR2 axis. As the incidence of kidney cancer continues to increase, new treatment strategies for this devastating disease are urgently needed. Zhou and colleagues provide preclinical proof of concept for a new therapeutic strategy and address an unmet need for this difficult to prevent and treat cancer disease.

      <data key="d2">Whitney L Hensing; Steven Poplack; Cheryl Herman; Foluso O Ademuyiwa</data>
      <data key="d3">Background: Screening mammography has been shown to decrease breast cancer mortality, yet adherence to guidelines is far from universal. It has been shown that screening rate are lower in vulnerable populations, such as black women and the uninsured. Increased breast cancer mortality among black women may, in part, be explained by lower screening rates. Prior studies have identified barriers to screening in black women, such as limited access to care, lack of insurance and poor social support. For women who manage to schedule an appointment, and overcome some of these barriers, compliance may still be sub-optimal. The purpose of this case-control study was to determine the no-show rate for scheduled screening mammogram at an urban tertiary care center and determine if racial differences in compliance exist. Methods: Participants were identified from women who scheduled an appointment for screening mammogram at the Joann Knight Breast Imaging Center in Saint Louis, MO between January 2018 and March 2018. Cases were defined as women who did not complete their initial appointment (no-show) and failed to reschedule within six months. Control subjects were defined as women who did complete their appointment and were randomly selected in a 1:1 ratio to cases. Demographic, financial and breast cancer history data was obtained from the electronic medical record. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds-ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: 5,922 appointments for screening mammograms were scheduled during the study period and 1003 (17%) were not completed. A total of 316 women were identified as cases (no-show) and an equal number were randomly selected to serve as controls. Black women were more likely to no-show than non-hispanic white women (OR = 2.64, 95% CI 1.90-3.67). This association was partially explained by several factors, as evidenced by change in the adjusted OR for race greater than 10%. The most notable of these factors were single marital status (adjusted OR for race = 1.87, 95% CI 1.29-2.72), uninsured or Medicaid insurance status (adjusted OR for race = 2.13, 95% CI 1.50-3.026) and residence within five-miles of the imaging center (adjusted OR for race = 2.05, 95% CI 1.43-2.95). Conclusion: We identified a no-show rate of 17% for screening mammograms at our institution. Black women were more likely to no-show than non-hispanic white women. The racial difference in no-show rate was partially explained by marital status, insurance status and distance of residence from the imaging center; suggesting that these factors are significant barriers to compliance with mammogram screening at our institution and these factors identify a particularly vulnerable population of black women.

 Background: Early studies reported a 4-6-fold risk of breast cancer between women with extremely dense and fatty breasts. As most early studies were case-control studies, we took advantage of a population-based screening program to study density and breast cancer incidence in a cohort design. Methods: In the Capital Region, Denmark, woman aged 50-69 are invited to screening biennially. Women screened November 2012 - December 2017 were included, and classified by BI-RADS density code, version 4, at first screen after recruitment. Women were followed up for incident breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), to 2020 in nationwide pathology data. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were compared across density groups using Poisson-regression. Results: We included 189,609 women; 1,067,293 person-years; and 4110 incident breast cancers/DCIS. Thirty-three percent of women had BI-RADS density code 1; 38% code 2; 24% code 3; 4.7% code 4; and missing 0.3%. Using women with BI-RADS density code 1 as baseline; women with code 2 had RR 1.69 (95% CI 1.56-1.84); women with code 3, RR 2.06 (95% CI 1.89-2.25); and women with code 4, RR 2.37 (95% CI 1.05-2.74). Results differed between observations accumulated during screening and above screening age. Conclusions: This cohort study showed a 2.37-fold difference in breast cancer risk between women with highest and lowest breast density. Translated into absolute risk of breast cancer after age 50, this was a 6.2% risk for the one-third of women with lowest density, and 14.7% for the five percent of women highest density.

      <data key="d3">Background. While a breast cancer diagnosis can be daunting for women of any age, studies have shown that young breast cancer survivors exhibit more emotional and psychological distress because of their relatively young age and life stage at diagnosis. In September 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded seven organizations, including Sharsheret, a national not-for-profit organization supporting young Jewish women and their families facing breast cancer, to develop support services and educational awareness activities for young breast cancer survivors. With this funding, Sharsheret developed the Thriving Again® (TA) survivorship program, which provides support services and resources, including a tailored survivorship kit with a survivorship care plan template, exercise DVD and healthy living cookbook. Participants were asked to complete an evaluation of services received to further enhance the program. Methods. Breast cancer survivors who received a TA survivorship kit were asked to complete an online or paper survey evaluating Sharsheret9s survivorship support services. Among 972 women who received the TA survivorship kit and were invited to complete an evaluation, 164 women returned the evaluation survey and 85 completed it in its entirety. Descriptive statistics on demographics and factors related to utilizing the survivorship care plan template and Sharsheret9s services were calculated and analyzed. The small sample size limited additional analyses. Results. Of the 85 women who completed the survey, 46% were Conclusion. Although breast cancer survivors may identify themselves as "survivors" at any point post-diagnosis, women responding to the survey who were satisfied with the timing of receiving the TA kit during their survivorship journey and who self-identified as a "survivor" were more likely to complete the care plan template. Women who reviewed the kit and learned more about TA with a member of Sharsheret9s support team were more likely to engage in other Sharsheret programs, most notably, Genetics for Life®. Although the sample size was small, the findings from this evaluation may be helpful to other survivorship programs. Most notably, other programs may need to be aware of how patients perceive themselves as survivors and offer care plans and resources when patients feel they most need them, even if patients have not yet completed treatment. The findings in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 Background: The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) is a gene expression-based signature comprising two functional biomarker panels. The Molecular Grade Index (MGI) is composed of five genes that measure tumor proliferation. BCI (H/I) is a ratio of the HOXB13 and IL17BR genes and measures estrogen signaling. Integration of MGI and BCI (H/I) provides a single prognostic score that quantifies the risk of both late (5-10 years) and overall (0-10 years) distant recurrence. BCI (H/I) has been validated to predict benefit from extended endocrine therapy across multiple adjuvant endocrine treatment backgrounds in several prospective-retrospective studies. Hormone receptor responses are dependent on genome-wide hormone receptor binding patterns. In hormone-dependent cancers, nuclear receptor binding patterns are frequently reprogrammed by other transcription factors. The homeobox transcription factor HOXB13 has previously been shown to reprogram genome-wide binding of the androgen receptor (AR) during prostate cancer tumorigenesis, where it colocalizes with FOXA1 at reprogrammed AR binding sites. Similarly, the transcription factor GATA3 was found to mediate enhancer accessibility at regulatory regions involved in estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription. We have shown previously that HOXB13 overexpression reprograms and expands the ER binding pattern in breast cancer cells. In this study, we have further characterized the role of HOXB13 in reprograming the ER cistrome and evaluated potential interactions with GATA3. Methods: HOXB13 was expressed in MCF-7 and T47D cells by electroporating HOXB13 mRNA or eGFP mRNA as control. Cells were harvested after 18 hours and analyzed by western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) using antibodies against ER, HOXB13, FOXA1, GATA3 and histone H3K27ac. Chromatin accessibility was assessed by ATAC-seq. After aligning reads with Bowtie2, peak calling, data integration and motif enrichment analysis was performed using HOMER v4.10. Results: ChIP-seq analysis of T47D cells expressing HOXB13 confirmed previous results in MCF-7 cells, where binding of HOXB13 to a significant number of genomic binding sites induced changes in binding of ER, FOXA1 and GATA3 compared to control cells. Integrative analysis of ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data revealed that HOXB13-induced reprogramming results in open chromatin that frequently exhibits increased acetylation of histone H3K27, a hallmark of transcriptional activation. While both increased chromatin accessibility and H3K27 acetylation were associated with HOX and AP-1 motif enrichment of the underlying DNA sequences, newly open chromatin was specifically co-enriched for motifs for pioneering factors such as FOXA1 and GRHL1. Conclusion: This study lends further support to a model of HOXB13-mediated reprogramming of the ER cistrome in breast cancer. Motif analysis of HOXB13-induced chromatin opening suggests interactions with other pioneer transcription factors including FOXA1 and GRHL1, while HOXB13-induced transcriptional activation is associated with motifs for activating factors such as AP-1. These results will be expanded to inducible cell lines to further characterize the effects of HOXB13 expression on ER binding and function.

      <data key="d3">Abstract A (p, 1)-total labeling of a graph G is an assignment of integers to V (G) ∪ E(G) such that (i) any two adjacent vertices of G receive distinct integers, (ii) any two adjacent edges of G receive distinct integers, and (iii) a vertex and an edge incident receive integers that differ by at least p in absolute value. The span of a (p, 1)-total labeling is the maximum difference between two labels. The minimum of span of all possible (p, 1)-total labeling of G is called the (p, 1)-total number and denoted by λp (G). The well known Havet and Yu Conjecture [6] states that for any connected graph G with ∆(G) ≤ 3 and G 6= K4, λ T 2 (G) ≤ 5. In this paper, we determine the (2, 1)-total number of cycle with parallel paths. This result supports the Havet and Yu conjecture.</data>

In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the graph operation, the duplication of all the vertices of graphs in obtaining graceful graphs. More precisely, we prove the following results. 1. If G admits a stronger version of graceful labeling, α-labeling, then the graph D(G) obtained by duplication of all the vertices of G admits α-labeling. 2. The graphs obtained by the duplication of all the vertices of the non-graceful graphs, C4∪K1,n, for all n ≥ 1 and n ̸= 2 and C3∪Pn, for all n ≥ 1 are graceful.

The p-liar’s domination number of G, denoted by γpLR(G), is the smallest cardinality of a p-liar’s dominating set of G. The 2-domination number γ(G) of G is the smallest cardinality of a 2-dominating set of G. It is shown that the difference γpLR(G) − γ(G) can be made arbitrarily large.

Although the accuracy of axillary temperature measurement is affected by a number of factors, device dwell time and device type are common. Objective. Compare body temperature between glass mercury thermometer (GMT) and digital thermometer (DT). Method. Comparative descriptive study was used. A total of 101 samples were taken with convenient sampling technique, but 98 were analyzed. Statistical significance () and clinical significance (°C) were used in the analyses. Correlations and Bland-Altman plots were used to observe agreements of the recording. Results. Mean difference (MD) of 10 min GMT and DT was . Statistically significant differences were noted in 10 min GMT and DT (). But the correlations were strong positive () and all MD were at the limit of agreement in Bland-Altman plot. Clinically, it is not significant (°C). Conclusion and Recommendations. Even though statistical significant differences () were noted between 10 min GMT and DT, the strong correlation, good agreements, and clinical insignificances make DT good alternative to the traditional GMT. Their variation in temperature is not likely to change any clinical decision. So, health professionals should use DT for measuring body temperature in under-5 febrile illnesses.</data>

The aim of this paper is to introduce iterative method having high convergence order but not involving higher derivatives. Our presented iterative method is free from third derivative and have convergence of order six. The efficiency index of this method is better than many existing methods in the literature.

      <data key="d3">Given a connected simple graph G and S ⊆ V (G), the geodetic closure IG[S] of S is the set of all vertices lying on some u-v geodesic where u and v are in S. In this paper, select vertices of G sequentially as follows: select a vertex v1 and let S1 = {v1}. Select a vertex v2 6= v1 and let S2 = {v1, v2}, then determine IG[S2]. If IG[S2] 6= V (G), then successively select a vertex vi / ∈ IG[Si−1] and let Si = {v1, v2, . . . , vi} for i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then determine IG[Si]. A subset S of V (G) is called a weakly connected closed geodetic set of G if the selection of vertex vk in the given manner yields IG[Sk] = V (G) and 〈S〉w is connected, where 〈S〉w = 〈N [S], Ew〉 with Ew consists of edges uv ∈ E(G) such that u ∈ S or v ∈ S. The minimum cardinality of weakly connected closed geodetic set is called the weakly connected closed geodetic number wcgn(G) of G. In this paper, the weakly connected closed geodetic sets of some common graphs and graphs resulting from the join of graphs are characterized. Also, the weakly connected closed geodetic numbers of these graphs are determined. This research is funded through the DOST-ASTHRDP. 258 Rachel M. Patangan, Imelda S. Aniversario and Rosalio G.

      <data key="d3">In the panorama of the state-of-the-art searches for extremely rare Charged Lepton Flavor Violating (CLFV) processes, the Mu-E-Gamma (MEG) experiment is definitely a reference point in the intensity frontier of modern physics research, setting the best upper limit on the μ + → e + γ decay. The upgrade of MEG, MEG II, wants to give further impetus to the CLFV searches with muons. MEG II relies on a series of upgrades: on the photon side we point up improvements of the γ detector resolutions and acceptance; on the positron side we rely on completely brand new detectors with better acceptance, efficiency and performances; on the Trigger and Data Acquisition (DAQ) side we are able to exploit a higher muon beam intensity despite the increased number of read out channels thanks to a new and optimized electronics. After three years of commissioning, in 2021 the MEG II experiment finally entered the physics data taking phase. An overview of the MEG II physics and experimental contexts is presented, together with the current detector performances based on data. Thanks to the new experimental apparatus the final sensitivity goal is expected to be one order of magnitude better than the first phase of MEG.</data>

      <data key="d3">Objectives The literature on learning styles is conflicting. Systematic reviews over the past 10 years have found no benefit to their use in education, but positive mentions of learning styles continue to be prevalent in the literature, and the clinician looking to expand their understanding of learning and teaching can easily miss the few critical articles that exist. We aimed to find out exactly how learning styles are interpreted and discussed in the medical education literature. Methods We conducted a scoping review, using the Arksey and O’Malley framework, to "map" the literature; producing an overview of the research area and its key concepts, without restrictions about the type or quality of study included Results 176 studies were included in the final analysis, of which only 28 expressed any reservations about learning styles. Publications in 2015 were double that of 2008 and came from every continent of the world. 122 studies stated as fact that different students have different learning styles, and 67 studies, that teaching should be matched to learning style. In only approximately half of these was this assertion supported by reference to another source. This positive view was maintained in many cases despite researchers’ own findings to the contrary. Conclusions Learning styles persist in the medical education literature, despite a lack of evidence to support their use and are often discussed as a scientific fact. The volume of work that mentions learning styles as an accepted fact inspires further work, which then plays its part in reinforcing acceptance of the theory. This uses time and money that could more usefully be spent researching other topics. Sometimes learning styles are used as a reason to advocate for a move to a more varied, student-centred curriculum, which results in good outcomes for the students despite the questionable theoretical argument for the change.

In 2005, HIMSS Analytics created the EMR Adoption Model (EMRAM), providing a roadmap and stage-bystage guidance for hospitals to assess their level of EMR adoption and utilization and the ability to compare themselves with others. In 2012, HIMSS created the Outpatient EMRAM (O-EMRAM) to measure EMR adoption and maturity in the outpatient setting. There are eight stages, zero to seven, and meeting the requirements of each stage moves you along the continuum. Table 1 shows the stages for hospitals and Table 2 shows the stages for the outpatient setting.1,2 Achieving EMRAM Stage 7 shows that a hospital or clinic is using the EMR to support optimized patient care. To achieve EMRAM Stage 7, there’s a detailed set of requirements or standards that must be achieved and demonstrated during a site visit. Only 6% of hospitals had achieved Stage 7 at the end of 2017.3 An EMR is a huge investment and to realize its benefits, an organization must continue to invest in both the technology and staff to facilitate optimizing and enhancing workflows and tools.

Such knowledge is required in order to respond to fundamental ideas in the Norwegian Curriculum and the Official Public Report about the school of the future (NOU 2015:8). This article seeks to answer how three students entering a more scholarly literature subject than before, make a place for themselves and each other in the literary conversation as a disciplinary practice. By means of James Paul Gee’s building tasks (2011), particularly the connections the students build in their meaning-making process, a literary group conversation among three high achieving students in the beginning of upper secondary school is studied. The analyses reveal that the students approach the text in different ways, activating experiences from different fields. They are engaged in the conversation and the text, take and give each other a place in the disciplinary community, and enter and form the disciplinary practice. The challenges the students encounter during the conversation are connected to a lack of tools to handle the wide range of possible interpretations and the text’s obstacles. Hence, this article points towards both possibilities and challenges in matters of literature education.Keywords: disciplinary practice and identity building, engagement, literary conversations, literature education</data>

      <data key="d3">Male allyship offers a key opportunity for men to serve as partners in fostering women’s sense of inclusion and belonging. Yet male allyship research rarely takes on a partnership lens to study allyship from the perspectives of both men and women in allyship dyads. In recent research that took a partnership lens to study male allyship in male-dominated environments within academia, severe challenges arose in recruiting dyadic samples. In this article, I explore why women in male-dominated fields within academia may choose not to participate in dyadic research by reviewing personal communications by non-respondents. Content analysis of the personal communications (n=50) revealed five themes: Work Pressure and Lack of Time, Lack of Anonymity, Being Judged for Work Priorities, Absence of Collegiality, and Hostile Workplace. Of note, the work environment of women in male-dominated disciplines of academia may be more challenging than other types of organizations, precipitating low participation in dyadic research. Implications for taking a partnership lens to conduct allyship research with women in male-dominated disciplines within academia are discussed.</data>

Since the discovery of cripto‐1 in the late 1980s, it has become a subject of biomarker investigation in several types of cancer which in many cases relies on immunolocalization of cripto‐1 using antibodies. Investigating cripto‐1 expression and localization in primary glioblastoma cells, we discovered nonspecific binding of cripto‐1 antibody to the extracellular matrix Geltrex. A panel of four cripto‐1 antibodies was investigated with respect to their binding to the Geltrex matrix and to the cripto‐1 positive control cells NTERA2. The cripto‐1 expression was varied for the different antibodies with respect to cellular localization and fixation methods. To further elaborate on these findings, we present a systematic review of cripto‐1 antibodies found in the literature and highlight some possible cross reactants with data on sequence alignments and structural comparison of EGF domains.</data>

      <data key="d3">The MEG II experiment at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland aims to achieve a sensitivity of 6 × 10−14 on the charged lepton flavor violating decay μ+ → e+γ. The current upper limit on this decay is 4.2× 10−13 at 90% Confidence Level (CL), set by the first phase of MEG. This result was achieved using the PSI muon beam at a reduced intensity, 3×107 μ+/s, to keep the background at a manageable level. The upgraded detectors in MEG II can cope with a higher intensity, thus the experiment is expected to run at a 7 × 107 μ+/s intensity. The new low mass, single volume, high granularity tracker, together with a new highly segmented timing counter, guarantees better resolutions for the positron detection. Moreover, the replacement of the old PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMTs) with Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs) in the inner face of the liquid xenon photon detector improved its performance. The details of the upgraded detectors and their present status will be discussed, together with the latest results from last year’s pre-engineering run and the perspective for the 2021 run, the first with all the detectors and electronics installed.</data>

      <data key="d3">The domain of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) explores how humans can interact with the computer without giving direct instruction. Recognizing the activity from brain signals affiliated with an electronic device might (i.e. MEG) provide a stepping stone in the field of BCI. The intended algorithm in the paper aimed at presenting a statistical strategy to classify the brain signal from the MEG signal data, provided by BCI competition IV dataset III. The algorithm is compartmentalized in three levels: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Autoregressive features have been extracted from the signals to classify using UNEQ, KNN and SIMCA, discuss the data distribution and asses how well the algorithm performs on unknown yet similar distribution. The proposed algorithm has obtained 64% prediction accuracy and 67% validation accuracy, which exceeds the current highest result reported on the same dataset.</data>

These spirits appear in the form of plants, animals, humans, cosmic forces, wind, mountains, and the sea. They relate to them as family or kin, offering assistance in the tasks of daily assistance. The idea of objects created of spirit and matter is central to the practice of sculpture.

      <data key="d3">Source activity was extracted from resting-state magnetoencephalography data of 103 subjects aged 18–60 years. The directionality of information flow was computed from the regional time courses using delay symbolic transfer entropy and phase entropy. The analysis yielded a dynamic source connectivity profile, disentangling the direction, strength, and time delay of the underlying causal interactions, producing independent time delays for cross-frequency amplitude-to-amplitude and phase-to-phase coupling. The computation of the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DoCM) allowed me to estimate the probability distribution of the DoCM independently of phase and amplitude. The results support earlier observations of a posterior-to-anterior information flow for phase dynamics in {α1, α2, β, γ} and an opposite flow (anterior to posterior) in θ. Amplitude dynamics reveal posterior-to-anterior information flow in {α1, α2, γ}, a sensory-motor β-oriented pattern, and an anterior-to-posterior pattern in {δ, θ}. The DoCM between intra- and cross-frequency couplings (CFC) are reported here for the first time and independently for amplitude and phase; in both domains {δ, θ, α1}, frequencies are the main contributors to DoCM. Finally, a novel brain age index (BAI) is introduced, defined as the ratio of the probability distribution of inter- over intra-frequency couplings. This ratio shows a universal age trajectory: a rapid rise from the end of adolescence, reaching a peak in adulthood, and declining slowly thereafter. The universal pattern is seen in the BAI of each frequency studied and for both amplitude and phase domains. No such universal age dependence was previously reported.</data>

      <data key="d3">The MEG experiment, at the PSI in Switzerland, aims at searching the charged lepton flavor violating decay $\mu^{+}\rightarrow e^{+}\gamma$. MEG has already determined the world best upper limit on the branching ratio: BR&lt;4.2$\times10^{-13}$@90\%CL with the full data set collected in the years 2009-2013.\\ 
The new positron tracker is a high transparency single volume, full stereo cylindrical Drift Chamber (DC), immersed in a non uniform longitudinal B-field, co-axial to the muon beam line with length of $1.93~m$ , internal radius of $17~cm$ and external radius of $30~cm$. It is composed of 10 concentric layers, divided in 12 identical sector of 16 drift cells. The single drift cell is approximately square, with a $20~\mu$m gold plated W sense wire surrounded by $40~\mu$m silver plated Al field wires in a ratio of 5:1. For equalizing the gain of the innermost and outermost layers, two guard layers have been added at proper radii and at appropriate high voltages. The total number of wires amounts to 12288 for an equivalent radiation length per track turn of about 1.45x10$^{-3}$ X$_{0}$ when the chamber is filled with an ultra-low mass gas mixture of helium and iso-butane. Due to the high wire density ($12 wires/cm^{2}$), the use of the classical feed-through technique as wire anchoring system could hardly be implemented and therefore it was necessary to develop new wiring strategies. The number of wires and the stringent requirements on the precision of their position and on the uniformity of the wire mechanical tension impose the use of an automatic system (wiring robot) to operate the wiring procedures. \\ 
Several tests have been performed in different prototypes of the drift chamber, exposed to cosmic rays, test beams and radioactive sources, to fulfill the requirement on the spatial resolution to be less than $110~\mu$m. The drift chamber is currently under construction at INFN and should be completed by the end of 2017 to be then delivered to PSI.</data>

      <data key="d1">2016</data>
      <data key="d2">Elizabeth W. Pang; O. C. Snead III</data>
      <data key="d3">New advances in structural neuroimaging have revealed the intricate and extensive connections within the brain, data which have informed a number of ambitious projects such as the mapping of the human connectome. Elucidation of the structural connections of the brain, at both the macro and micro levels, promises new perspectives on brain structure and function that could translate into improved outcomes in functional neurosurgery. The understanding of neuronal structural connectivity afforded by these data now offers a vista on the brain, in both healthy and diseased states, that could not be seen with traditional neuroimaging. Concurrent with these developments in structural imaging, a complementary modality called magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been garnering great attention because it too holds promise for being able to shed light on the intricacies of functional brain connectivity. MEG is based upon the elemental principle of physics that an electrical current generates a magnetic field. Hence, MEG uses highly sensitive biomagnetometers to measure extracranial magnetic fields produced by intracellular neuronal currents. Put simply then, MEG is a measure of neurophysiological activity, which captures the magnetic fields generated by synchronized intraneuronal electrical activity. As such, MEG recordings offer exquisite resolution in the time and oscillatory domain and, as well, when co-registered with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer excellent resolution in the spatial domain. Recent advances in MEG computational and graph theoretical methods have led to studies of connectivity in the time-frequency domain. As such, MEG can elucidate a neurophysiological-based functional circuitry that may enhance what is seen with MRI connectivity studies. In particular, MEG may offer additional insight not possible by MRI when used to study complex eloquent function, where the precise timing and coordination of brain areas is critical. This article will review the traditional use of MEG for functional neurosurgery, describe recent advances in MEG connectivity analyses, and consider the additional benefits that could be gained with the inclusion of MEG connectivity studies. Since MEG has been most widely applied to the study of epilepsy, we will frame this article within the context of epilepsy surgery and functional neurosurgery for epilepsy.</data>

      <data key="d3">Lepton flavor violating decay of muon is one of the best probes for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). A golden channel, μ → eγ, will be searched by the MEG II experiment. MEG II aims to search μ → eγ with ten times better branching ratio sensitivity than MEG, 6 × 10−14 (90% C.L.). Many well motivated BSM theories predict sizable branching ratio of this decay (e.g. O(10−14) in SUSY-seesaw), which is within the reach of MEG II. MEG II utilizes world’s highest intensity continuous μ beam (7 × 107 muons/s) at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). In order to cope with extremely high rate accidental background of e and γ, all the detectors are upgraded from MEG. Detectors are installed and commissioned with muon beam at PSI.

      <data key="d3">Accurate prediction of extreme weather and climate is crucial for their devastating impacts on our society and environment. Here, predictability of frequency of summer (June–August) extreme hot days (SEHDs) in China has been assessed in the SINTEX‐F2 seasonal forecast system during the period of 1983–2015. The hindcast had 12 ensemble members and was initialized on the first day of March, April and May, respectively. Results show that overall, the SINTEX‐F2 predicts more regions with good prediction skills at shorter lead time due to its better capture of the linear trends. Whereas, in Southwest China and eastern Tibetan Plateau, the prediction skills are consistently increased at shorter lead time even without the impacts of linear trends; the correlation coefficients between the region‐mean anomalies in the observed and predicted SEHD frequencies are 0.74, 0.68 and 0.61 at 1–3 month lead, respectively, and they remain as high as 0.56, 0.49 and 0.40 when the linear trends are removed. This is because the SINTEX‐F2 can reproduce the observed influences of Indian Ocean Basin Mode (IOBM) on the SEHD frequency. The warm IOBM can cause anomalous ascending and strong divergence in the upper troposphere over the tropical Indian Ocean and Indian subcontinent. The strong divergence causes direct convergence and descending over Southwestern China and eastern Tibetan Plateau. It also causes substantial descending over the western North Pacific that can introduce anomalous cyclonic circulation over northeastern Asia via the Pacific‐Japan or East‐Asia pattern. The latter serves as a source of wave energies, excites the Rossby waves meandering westward in the mid‐latitude, and enhances the anticyclonic circulation anomalies over Southwestern China and eastern Tibetan Plateau.</data>

      <data key="d3">Focal epilepsy originates within networks in one hemisphere. However, previous studies have investigated network topologies for the entire brain. In this study, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to investigate functional intra‐hemispheric networks of healthy controls (HCs) and patients with left‐ or right‐hemispheric temporal lobe or temporal plus extra‐temporal lobe epilepsy. 22 HCs, 25 left patients (LPs), and 16 right patients (RPs) were enrolled. The debiased weighted phase lag index was used to calculate functional connectivity between 246 brain regions in six frequency bands. Global efficiency, characteristic path length, and transitivity were computed for left and right intra‐hemispheric networks. The right global graph measures (GGMs) in the theta band were significantly different (p &lt; .005) between RPs and both LPs and HCs. Right and left GGMs in higher frequency bands were significantly different (p &lt; .05) between HCs and the patients. Right GGMs were used as input features of a Naïve‐Bayes classifier to classify LPs and RPs (78.0% accuracy) and all three groups (75.5% accuracy). The complete theta band brain networks were compared between LPs and RPs with network‐based statistics (NBS) and with the clustering coefficient (CC), nodal efficiency (NE), betweenness centrality (BC), and eigenvector centrality (EVC). NBS identified a subnetwork primarily composed of right intra‐hemispheric connections. Significantly different (p &lt; .05) nodes were primarily in the right hemisphere for the CC and NE and primarily in the left hemisphere for the BC and EVC. These results indicate that intra‐hemispheric MEG networks may be incorporated in the diagnosis and lateralization of focal epilepsy.</data>

      <data key="d3">Mangroves are vital in providing habitats for a diverse community of organisms. They are beneficial to the marine environment and people. However, threats are felt as the population of mangroves are affected by human activities. In addressing these problems, one technique that has potential in avoiding the annihilation of mangroves is building of nurseries. But in building nurseries, organizations fail to consider the parameters that may affect the growth of mangrove. Consequently, after replantation, the propagules die due to acclimatization. It is along this line that this project is undertaken to develop a conditioning system that will help the nurseries to replicate the parameters of their habitat in terms of pH, salinity, temperature, and depth of water. The prototype consists of two devices: one is the data acquisition and transmitting device and the automated conditioning nursery. The first device acquires the data parameters using different sensors interfaced with a microcontroller and sends data to the conditioning nursery. The automated conditioning nursery will then mimic the received data. Through GSM, the reference data and measured data from the controlled nursery will be send to the user for monitoring purposes. The validation result shows that the difference of the measurement of the parameters in the ecological habitat and conditioning nursery were not statistically significant. In addition, the propagules did not obtain discoloration, which is the reference to indicate a healthy propagule. Thus, the system developed in this study can be considered safely functionally operational with the specific features included in its design.</data>

      <data key="d3">Objective Whole-head on scalp magnetoencephalography (osMEG) is a novel, cutting-edge functional neuroimaging technique that positions MEG sensors closer to the cortical sources. OsMEG allows both for free head movements and improved spatial resolution compared to conventional MEG. OsMEG thus might improve clinical epilepsy evaluations. However, it remains largely unknown how osMEG characterizes epileptic activity. Here, we aimed to compare epileptic activity source estimation accuracy of osMEG, high-density EEG (hd-EEG), conventional MEG (convMEG) and subdural EEG (sbdEEG). Method IED and seizure onset zone source estimations of osMEG, hdEEG, convMEG and sbdEEG were evaluated using equivalent current dipoles. Cancellation index of all non-invasive modalities were calculated and compared statistically. To further investigate any similarity between osMEG and sbdEEG, representational similarity analysis was used to compare IED source estimations of these two modalities. Results We found that osMEG IED source estimations were significantly (p&lt;0.05) better than both convMEG and hdEEG. Furthermore, osMEG mesial temporal lobe SOZ source estimations were superior to those of convMEG and hdEEG. OsMEG cancellation index did not differ significantly from convMEG. Interestingly, comparing osMEG and sbdEEG IED source estimation demonstrated that osMEG might be less sensitive to source directions than convMEG. Conclusion We demonstrated that whole-head osMEG exhibited very accurate non-invasive IED and SOZ source estimations, better than both hd-EEG and convMEG. Significance OsMEG has a promising potential to become a safe, highly sensitive neuroimaging modality for whole head epilepsy evaluations.

      <data key="d3">Abstract Let X X be a simple normal crossing (SNC) compact complex surface with trivial canonical bundle which includes triple intersections. We prove that if X X is d d -semistable, then there exists a family of smoothings in a differential geometric sense. This can be interpreted as a differential geometric analogue of the smoothability results due to Friedman, Kawamata-Namikawa, Felten-Filip-Ruddat, Chan-Leung-Ma, and others in algebraic geometry. The proof is based on an explicit construction of local smoothings around the singular locus of X X , and the first author’s existence result of holomorphic volume forms on global smoothings of X X . In particular, these volume forms are given as solutions of a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation. As an application, we provide several examples of d d -semistable SNC complex surfaces with trivial canonical bundle including double curves, which are smoothable to complex tori, primary Kodaira surfaces, and K 3 K3 surfaces. We also provide several examples of such complex surfaces including triple points, which are smoothable to K 3 K3 surfaces.</data>

This study aimed to investigate the anthropometric and physiological variables associated with BSV and explore strength and conditioning programs to increase BSV in collegiate baseball players. Seventy-eight collegiate baseball players (mean age ± SD, 19.4 ± 1.0 years) participated in this study. Maximum BSV (km/h) was measured using Blast Baseball (Blast Motion Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). The anthropometric and physiological variables measured were height, body mass, lean body mass, grip strength, back muscle strength, the 30 m sprint, standing long jump, and backward overhead medicine ball throwing. Analysis using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient showed a weak but significant positive correlation between all anthropometric measurements to BSV. Significant relationships existed between physiological variables of hand grip, back muscle strength, and backward overhead medicine ball throwing, but not the standing long jump and 30 m sprint. These data show that BSV is related to anthropometric and physiological variables, particularly upper and lower body strength and full-body explosive power. Based on the results of this study, we designed examples of sound training programs to increase BSV. Strength and conditioning coaches may want to consider using this information when designing a training program for collegiate baseball players.</data>

Collected data on weight and height were used to calculate body mass index z-scores of WHO standards. Models included grade, gender, number of friends, household income, location of school and depressive symptoms as covariates. The results showed that both high and low DOI were positively associated with thinness after adjustment for other individual covariates (high DOI, OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.05–2.43; low DOI, OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.36–3.06). Further stratification by gender revealed that low DOI was positively associated with thinness (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.34–3.44) among boys, but there was no association among girls. Both high and low DOI were associated with the risk of being thin in adolescents. Focusing on DOI for adolescents may be important to address thinness among adolescents.

The VCM concentration at 0 min after adding 3% Tsururinko Quickly to VCM powders (Shionogi and Meiji) was lower than that of the control (Shionogi: 65.15% ± 35.57%, Meiji: 77.00% ±15.81% (mean ± standard deviation), **P &lt; 0.01, Dunnet 's test). However, the VCM concentration at 30 min after the addition recovered to the control level. The drug susceptibility tests for C. difficile and Staphylococcus aureus using the disk diffusion method showed no effect of addition of 3% Tsururinko Quickly. Our in vitro evaluations showed that the addition of xanthan gum-based thickeners to VCM powders had a negligible effect on the treatment of CDI.</data>

      <data key="d3">Nanocrystalline nickel–cobalt (Ni–Co) binary alloy sheets were fabricated through electroforming in an acidic aqueous bath using exfoliation from a metallic titanium cathode. Cobalt content in Ni–Co alloy sheets ranged from 28.8 at% to 72.0 at% depending on experimental parameters, such as cathodic overpotential and bath composition. The surface roughness (R a) of the electroformed alloy sheets significantly decreased down to 1.5 μm as saccharin sodium dihydrate was added as an additive to the acidic aqueous solution bath. X-ray diffraction profiles and transmission electron microscopy images indicated that the electroformed Ni–Co alloy sheets have a nanocrystalline structure (grain size ≈ 30 nm). The lattice constant of the electroformed Ni–Co alloy sheets increased with an increase in cobalt content (i.e. solute atom concentration). The mechanical properties were significantly improved because of the synergistic effects of crystal grain refinement and solid solution strengthening. The microhardness and tensile strength of the electroformed Ni–Co alloy sheets reached 609 kgf mm−2 and 1757 MPa (X Co = 49.9 at%), respectively. The tensile strength of the electroformed Ni–Co alloy sheets in this study significantly exceeded that of solidified Ni–Co alloys (approximately 370 MPa). Therefore, this study offers a technique to enhance the mechanical properties of electroformed Ni–Co alloy sheets.</data>

      <data key="d3">Background: Little League elbow, including humeral epicondylitis and osteochondritis dissecans, is a severe throwing injury in school-aged pitchers. Recent rule revisions have been implemented, and thus, prevention awareness may have increased. Purpose: To compare the incidence of elbow injury in 2011 from a previous study with that in 2021 and examine changes in the incidence and characteristics of players with elbow injuries. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A survey based on the 2011 survey was conducted from September 1 to December 31, 2021, among 4060 third- to sixth-grade Little League players belonging to 203 teams in Kyoto, Japan. This survey included a 23-item checklist on physical condition and injury. The participants were classified into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of an elbow injury in the dominant arm during the season. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was conducted to compare differences in basic information between the 2 groups. We also compared the differences in the 23 checklist items between the 2 groups using the chi-square or Fisher exact probability test. Results: Overall, 98 teams (1335 players; age range, 8-12 years) returned the questionnaires (collection rate, 32.9%). The final analysis population (excluding incomplete questionnaires) was 678 (mean age, 10.6 ± 1.1 years). Elbow injuries accounted for 30.7% of all injury sites in the players. Overall, 61 players (9.0%) reported elbow injuries in 2021 compared with 19.1% of the players in the 2011 survey (P &lt; .01) A significantly higher percentage of players with elbow injuries had elbow pain in extension (item 2 on the survey checklist, P &lt; .001) and flexion (item 4, P &lt; .0024), were regular players (item 5, P = .0288), played baseball under fatigue (item 8, P = .0028), and had lower and upper limb inflexibility (item 17, P = .0379; item 18, P = .0146; and item 22, P = .0085). Conclusion: Study findings indicated that the incidence of elbow injuries has decreased significantly over the past 10 years, although the elbow joint still accounted for almost one-third of all injuries in Japanese youth baseball players.</data>

      <data key="d3">INTRODUCTION
Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been associated with an unacceptably high mortality of 50% or more. Successful discontinuation of RRT is thought to be linked to better outcomes. Although functional and structural renal markers have been evaluated in AKI, little is known about their roles in predicting outcomes at the time of RRT discontinuation.


METHODS
In this prospective single-center cohort study, we analyzed patients who received continuous RRT (CRRT) for AKI between August 2016 and March 2018 in the intensive care unit of the University of Tokyo Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). Clinical parameters and urine samples were obtained at CRRT discontinuation. Successful CRRT discontinuation was defined as neither resuming CRRT for 48 h nor receiving intermittent hemodialysis for 7 days from the CRRT termination. Major adverse kidney events (MAKEs) were defined as death, requirement for dialysis, or a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of more than 25% from the baseline at day 90.


RESULTS
Of 73 patients, who received CRRT for AKI, 59 successfully discontinued CRRT and 14 could not. Kinetic eGFR, urine volume, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and urinary L-type fatty acid binding protein were predictive for CRRT discontinuation. Of these factors, urine volume had the highest area under the curve (AUC) 0.91 with 95% confidence interval [0.80-0.96] for successful CRRT discontinuation. For predicting MAKEs at day 90, the urinary NGAL showed the highest AUC 0.76 [0.62-0.86], whereas kinetic eGFR and urine volume failed to show statistical significance (AUC 0.49 [0.35-0.63] and AUC 0.59 [0.44-0.73], respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Our prospective study confirmed that urine volume, a functional renal marker, predicted successful discontinuation of RRT and that urinary NGAL, a structural renal marker, predicted long-term renal outcomes. These observations suggest that the functional and structural renal makers play different roles in predicting the outcomes of severe AKI requiring RRT.</data>

      <data key="d3">Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was originally reported from Japan as one of the subsets of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without gradient, usually associated with deep T-wave inversion and a spade-like appearance of the left ventricle. Although many reports from Japan have indicated that these patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are mostly asymptomatic and have relatively good prognosis, data on serious ventricular arrhythmias are not yet available. Present documentation of ventricular tachycardia in a patient with this disease suggests that at least some of such patients are also at risk of sudden death and that a systematic study for life-threatening arrhythmia by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring may be necessary in these cases.</data>

      <data key="d3">Safety is impaired when drivers are required to perform main driving task (tracking of own car, distance maintenance between own car and a leading car, and response to target objects) and secondary task simultaneously, for example, responding to target cars on the road while operating in-vehicle equipment. A two-factor (presence or absence of tactile warning by input modality (no secondary task, voice command for a secondary task, and manual input for a secondary task)) within-subject design of ten licensed males was used to investigate how to compensate for safety impairments (decreased performance of a main and a secondary task such as increased tracking error during driving or increased reaction time to target cars on the road). We investigated whether the use of tactile warnings transmitted via left and right thighs for detecting road objects and voice command to operate in-vehicle equipment could compensate for safety impairments such as the increased reaction time to target cars on the road, the increase of detection error of target cars, or increased tracking error in driving. The accuracy and speed of responses to target cars encountered during driving were reduced when a driver was asked to perform the main and the secondary task simultaneously compared to situations performing only the main driving task (tracking, distance maintenance, and response to target cars). The availability of a tactile warning system for road objects compensated for these diminished performance measures, including slower response times and the increased detection error of target cars. Likewise, voice command contributed to enhanced performance of the main driving task such as decrease of tracking error.</data>

      <data key="d3">Aims Cardiac mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) is likely to be aggravated by malnutrition, assessed by serum cholinesterase (ChE) level, as well as by kidney dysfunction or impairment of cardiac sympathetic denervation. Their prognostic interactions, however, have not been determined. Methods A total of 991 systolic HF patients were enrolled in our HF database following clinical evaluation including evaluation of the nutrition state and assessment of standardized heart-to-mediastinum ratio (sHMR) of iodine-123-labeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine activity. Patients were followed up for an average of 43 months with the primary endpoint of fatal cardiac events (CEs). Results The CE patient group had a lower level of ChE, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and lower late sHMR than those in the non-CE patient group. A five-parameter model with the addition of serum ChE selected in the multivariate logistic analysis (model 2) significantly increased the AUC predicting risk of cardiac events compared with a four-parameter model without serum ChE (model 1), and net reclassification analysis also suggested that the model with the addition of serum cholinesterase significantly improved cardiac event prediction. Moreover, in overall multivariate Cox hazard analysis, serum ChE, eGFR and late sHMR were identified to be significant prognostic determinants. HF patients with two or all of the prognostic variables of serum ChE &lt; 230 U/L, eGFR &lt; 48.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 and late sHMR &lt; 1.90 had significantly and incrementally increased CE rates compared to those in HF patients with none or only one of the prognostic variables. Conclusion Decreases in cholinesterase level and kidney function further increase cardiac mortality risk in HF patients with impairment of cardiac sympathetic innervation.</data>

      <data key="d3">Many Indian companies from manufacturing sectors such as industrial, consumer discretionary, and materials have forayed into international markets through exports, overseas ventures, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), joint ventures, etc. Still, there remain unanswered findings to be gained from new research to measure the degree of internationalization (DOI) of international business operations by applying an index, for the first time, to Indian manufacturing companies. Moreover, existing studies, predominantly emanating from developed economies, have explored DOI in the context of developed economies. The extant approaches are limited because explaining the phenomenon of measuring the DOI of firms from emerging economies using frameworks designed for companies in developed countries may lead to incorrect results, as they are characterized by institutional voids like poor governance, greater governmental control, and nascent institutions. This original empirical investigation researched vital phenomena pertaining to Indian manufacturing companies by addressing the gaps outlined above. Researchers can cite germane measures of DOI via the proposed index to support academics and practitioners to determine whether a specific Indian manufacturing company has recently ventured into or plans to launch into the international markets by employing a more thorough composite measure of DOI.</data>

The large binding energy of NO2 chemisorbed onto BPDT (∼2.04 eV) in the Comment conflicts with existing theoretical and experimental evidence. Grigoriev et al. have attempted to compare their results to our findings, employing different approximation schemes under the density functional theory (DFT) framework.

      <data key="d3">It has been reported that many crashes are caused by drowsiness. Thus, it is critical to predict the occurrence of severe drowsiness that may result in a crash by means of an effective measure. The aim of this study was to investigate whether percentage closure (PERCLOS) of 70% was useful for evaluating drowsiness level of individual drivers and preventing crashes caused by drowsy driving using a driving simulator system. The first experiment measured PERCLOS70 during both aroused and drowsy states in a driving simulator task and investigated how PERCLOS70 changes when a participant fell asleep. In the second experiment, we measured PERCLOS70 and investigated the relation between PERCLOS70 and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) ratings during a simulated driving task. The aggregated mean PERCLOS70 was significantly higher when participants fell asleep than when they were aroused. This tendency was also observed for individual participants. The aggregated mean PERCLOS70 was found to be sensitive to changes in KSS scores and increased with increasing KSS score. Linear trend analysis revealed a significant increasing trend for PERCLOS70 as a function of the KSS rating. This tendency was also observed for individual participants. PERCLOS70 was found to be sensitive to the drowsiness level both for data aggregated across all participants and data for individual participants. The main findings of the two experiments reported herein suggest that PERCLOS70 can be used effectively to evaluate drowsiness of individual drivers and prevent crashes caused by drowsy driving.</data>

Oysa PDF dosya içinde güncel veri bulunuyorken makale üst verisi, çalışmanın güncel olmayan ilk hâlindeki bilgileri içeriyor olabilmektedir. DOI atanması, teknik bir süreçtir. Önce makaleye dair asgari bilgilerin Crossref sistemine gönderilerek DOI atanması, ikinci olarak da makale üst verisinin Crossref sistemine eksiksiz olarak kaydedilmesi gerekmektedir. Bu ikinci işlem birçok yayıncı tarafından yapılmamaktadır. Makalelere ücret ödenerek DOI atandığı hâlde, makale üst verisi Crossref’e gönderilmediği için uluslararası camiaya açılmamaktadır. Bir diğer sorun ise makale üst verilerinin Crossref’e sadece makale dilinde gönderilmesidir. Oysa Crossref’e Türkçe ve İngilizce dillerinde zengin üst veri gönderilmesi teknik açıdan mümkündür.

      <data key="d2">Matthias REUSS</data>
      <data key="d3">Exchangeability of machine tools requires identical results of identical machining operation. For estimating the behaviour of machine tools, which are highly integrated mechatronic systems, the interaction of electromechanic system and controller must be observed together. Furthermore, it is possible to measure friction at start-up in serial production of machine tools and at the production plants of machine tool consumers without any additional measuring equipment. By these measurements of friction severe variances of behaviour of feed axes have been detected. These are mainly caused by assembly variances. Especially the alignments and preloads of bearings and ball screw have a strong effect because these components have a high stiffness. This means even smallest deviations result in high constraining forces, which directly affect the friction behaviour. Since it is impossible to determine the reasons of these variances in completely assembled machine tools, a test stand of a ball screw driven axis is examined. This test stand allows both detailed identification of components’ friction behaviour and definite variations of assembly conditions, namely alignment and preload, of bearings and ball screw nut. Hence a detailed investigation of effects of assembly variations becomes possible and has been conducted for alignment of ball screw nut and loose bearing. However, by this examination only the effects on the complete system can be examined but not the situation of constraining forces within the components. The knowledge of these internal forces is important because they directly affect the life expectancy of components and therewith feed drives. In order to improve the significance and to estimate the effect of assembly variances in detail, a modelling method based on multibody simulation has been developed and verified by comparison of measuring results of the test bed and simulation.</data>

In previous feature-based simplification methods, a CAD model is progressively simplified by suppressing individual features with low importance one at a time, whereas in the proposed method, each feature itself is progressively simplified based on its feature type. The proposed method provides a user with a further subdivided level of simplification. In the proposed method, features are categorized into sketch-based features and non-sketch-based features. The sketch-based features are simplified using three sketch simplification operations. The non-sketch-based features are simplified by converting them into simpler features, or changing their parameters. To demonstrate the proposed method, we present the implementation and experiment results.</data>

We propose three kinds of home–away tables, an even-breaks table, a consecutive-breaks table, and a k -interval table, which are fairer than the previously proposed home–away tables. To ﬁnd consecutive-breaks and k -interval home–away tables consistent with a given timetable, we propose algorithms based on 2-satisﬁability.

      <data key="d3">A pretension design method is proposed for the cablenet system of large span cable-beam structure. This method can improve computational efficiency of pretension design under influence of beams’ deformations. In this method, cablenet system is divided into two parts—inner cablenet and edge cablenet. Inner cablenet is a pure cablenet area, its optimal pretension distribution can be easily found by using balance matrix analysis method. Edge cablenet is the other cablenet area connected with beams, and for this cablenet system, an iterative calculation combined with balance matrix analysis method and nonlinear finite element method is used to calculate its reasonable pretension distributions. In the iteration process, the shape of edge cablenet is iteratively updated according to displacements of connection joints between edge cablenet and beams, and based on these shape changes, pretension distributions of edge cablenet is recalculated iteratively. And by using this method, influence of beams’ deformations can be added to cablenet pretension design. Because above complicated iterative calculation is just limited to the edge cablenet, scale of nonlinear finite element calculation in the iteration will be much smaller than calculation for the whole cable-beam structure, and the efficiency and accuracy of this calculation can be also improved at the same time. At last, this method is programmed for a numerical example, and the results indicate that the method is feasible.</data>

And the similarity between processes could be measured with the similarity between process cells and the similarity between process routes by the process model. Based on the process similarity, affinity propagation method was used to cluster the process.

      <data key="d3">Abstract Hypoid gear machining is a critical process in automobile industries. Many studies have discussed the gear machining in the geometrical model for manufacturing and design of the gears. In terms of the cutting process, the accuracies of the gears largely depend on the cutting forces. Therefore, the cutting force should be estimated to perform the high accurate gear cutting. However, few studies have been done on prediction of the cutting force. Analytical predictions of the cutting forces are required for manufacturing of gears with high qualities. This study presents an analytical model to predict cutting force in the hypoid gear cutting, in which the gear grooves are machined by sets of inner and outer cutting blades. Both of the blades finish the side and the end faces in the gear grooves. Different chip flows occurs on the end and the side edges of the blades. The chip flows are modeled by piling up orthogonal cuttings containing the cutting and the chip flow directions, where the chip flow direction is determined to minimize the cutting energy. The cutting forces loaded on the inner and the outer blades are predicted in the chip flow models. The presented model is validated in the cutting tests with measuring the cutting forces.</data>

      <data key="d3">Job shop scheduling with the availability of more than one machine to perform an operation, also known as the flexible job shop scheduling problem, is computationally NP-hard. An efficient scheduling method is proposed here, using a genetic algorithm that incorporates heuristic rules. The scheduler’s goal is to minimize mean tardiness. There are two types of decision making required: job selection and machine selection. Combinations of five job selection and five machine selection heuristics are examined. Numerical experiments show that the combination of Yoda et al.’s (SL/RPN)+SPT rule for job selection and Eguchi et al.’s (WINQ+RPT+PT)×PT rule for machine selection provide the best performance under different shop conditions when incorporated into the genetic algorithm. It is also found that applying genetic algorithm only for either job selection or machine selection can generate good schedules, depending on conditions. An efficient scheduling method using a genetic algorithm that incorporate heuristic rules has been proposed. The GA uses a random key coding approach not only for job selection but also for machine selection, whose effectiveness has been confirmed through numerical experiment. With this coding approach, heuristic rules can be easily incorporated into the GA. Five job selection rules and five machine selection rules were examined as heuristics for incorporation into the GA. Numerical experiments show that the combination of the (SL/RPN)+SPT rule for job selection and the (WINQ+RPT+PT)×PT rule for machine selection performs best for minimizing the mean tardiness of jobs in various conditions. Numerical experiments also show that applying the GA only to job selection or machine selection performs better than applying the GA both to job and machine selection. These experiments revealed that one of the reasons for this phenomenon is the complexity of searching job and machine selections simultaneously when the scale of the problem is large. reason is importance of job selection and varies depending on conditions. effect of job selection diminishes. obtained GA to selection in However, the GA to job selection is also effective under conditions in which important, such as when machines exist.</data>

      <data key="d3">When the microscope was first introduced to scientists in the 17th century, it started a revolution. Suddenly, a whole new world, invisible to the naked eye, was opened to curious explorers. In response to this realization, Nehemiah Grew, an English plant anatomist and physiologist and one of the early microscopists, noted in 1682 “that Nothing hereof remains further to be known, is a Thought not well Calculated”. Since Grew made his observations, the microscope has undergone numerous variations, developing from early compound microscopes—hollow metal tubes with a lens on each end—to the modern, sophisticated, out‐of‐the‐box super‐resolution microscopes available to researchers today. In this Overview article, I describe these developments and discuss how each new and improved variant of the microscope led to major breakthroughs in the life sciences, with a focus on the plant field. These advances start with Grew's simple and—at the time—surprising realization that plant cells are as complex as animals cells, and that the different parts of the plant body indeed qualify to be called “organs”, then move on to the development of the groundbreaking “cell theory” in the mid‐19th century and the description of eu‐ and heterochromatin in the early 20th century, and finish with the precise localization of individual proteins in intact, living cells that we can perform today. Indeed, Grew was right; with ever‐increasing resolution, there really does not seem to be an end to what can be explored with a microscope. © 2022 The Authors.

      <data key="d3">This study considers an assembly line in which multiple items that closely resemble each other are present. The line is divided into stations, and goods are simultaneously assembled by workers assigned to each station. It is assumed that a worker cannot move with a product to perform work outside the boundary of an individual station. Work is assumed to be equally assigned among all stations. However, work differs depending on the item and station. If products that consume a long assembly time are consecutively processed by the same station, processing may not be completed within individual stations. Therefore, an important aspect that should be considered is the sequencing of product introduction (Kotani, 2007; Kotani and Ohno, 2004; Kotani and Suzuki, 2007; Thomopoulos, 1967). In studies on sequencing in mixed-model assembly lines, the objective function, roughly divided into two types, has been used. One aims at minimizing line shutdown time when processing cannot be completed within a station (Boysen et al., 2009; Shimizu et al., 2009; Xiaobo and Ohno, 1997; Yoo et al., 2004), and the other aims at minimizing additional resources, assuming the use of additional power resources (i.e., total unfinished work time) to avoid shutting down the operation of a line (Bard et al., 1992; Bautista and Cano, 2011; Bautista and Cano, 2008; Bautista and Pereira, 2009; Leu, 1997; Scholl et al., 1998; Yano and Rachamadugu, 1991). Most approaches to minimize total unfinished work time have used the branch-and-bound method or heuristic method. Yano and Rachamadugu (1991) determined the longest filing off that would not produce unfinished work time in the single-station model and proposed a heuristic method that utilizes the longest filing. Bautista and Cano (2008) proposed the up–down (Ud) heuristic method for the single-station model and introduced a method for constructing a solution using the results of the Ud method for each station as approximate values for a mixed-item assembly line comprising multiple stations. Although the heuristic method used by Bautista and Cano (2008) was capable of providing a precise solution, it was not very effective when applied to the lower bound of the branch-and-bound method, requiring a large number of solutions to be enumerated as numerical examples.

      <data key="d3">In face-to-face conversation, embodied rhythms between speech and body movements such as nodding are mutually synchronized between talkers such as a speaker and a listener. This synchrony is called entrainment in communication and it generates the sharing of embodiment in human interaction. Embodied communication, which is closely related to behavioral and physiological entrainment, is an essential form of communication that forms the basis of interaction between talkers through mutual embodiment. In particular, nodding has an important role as a regulator in embodied interaction and communication. The detection of nodding is useful for an estimation of the activity of conversation. In this paper, we develop a nodding detection system using a nodding detection model based on an analysis of the head movement involved in nodding. This model detects nodding based on the rotational movement of the head, which is estimated from the face tracking of the Active Appearance Model. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated by comparing the result of the nodding detection results with visual inspection.The developed nodding detection system is demonstrated in an actual event for children.</data>

      <data key="d3">Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play key roles in the host's innate immune response to insult. The assembly of an inflammatory complex is initiated with the oligomerization of the upstream inflammasome‐forming sensor and then follows a well‐orchestrated multi‐step process leading to downstream effector functions that are critical in the innate immune response. The final assembly of these steps provides a detectable readout of inflammasome complex activation in the form of an apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck. Inflammasome activation—and the release of IL‐1β and ASC specks from the microglia, the brain resident immune cell—have been implicated in various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Protocols exist for the generation of fluorescent inflammasome indicator peripheral macrophages. Building upon these protocols, we describe here a protocol that details the generation of fluorescent inflammasome indicator microglia cells using recombinant retroviruses to transduce murine BV‐2 cells. In this protocol, the cells are established in a manner to allow for experimental control of the initial priming step of the inflammasome activation process. We then provide a series of steps for using these reporter cells within an inflammasome activation assay and use real‐time imaging of ASC‐speck formation as an indicator of inflammasome activation. In addition, we describe strategies for using these cells for examining the effects of a test substance on inflammasome activation. This protocol offers an effective approach conducive to screening for and examining modifications of microglia inflammasome activation due to exposure to chemicals or pharmacological agents. © Published 2022.

      <data key="d3">The present paper discusses the integration of product design and manufacturing by means of information sharing through due-date estimation and scheduling systems. The present author and other researchers have investigated a due-date estimation method in a make-to-order context. We analyzed and considered several manufacturing problems using the due-date estimation method. Among the problems researched were the following two: the first is the problem of optimizing the allocation of module inventories on semi-finished products and processed parts, and the second is the due-date estimation and production scheduling for customer orders with unfixed specification. In conducting our research, we realized that these problems are closely related with the integration of product design and manufacturing. In the present paper, we discuss the concrete examples found in these two problems and verify that the information sharing between the product design section and the manufacturing division is necessary in order to meet the increasingly strict requirements of customers and achieve more efficient manufacturing.</data>

      <data key="d3">The coefficient of variation (CV) is an important quality parameter to measure the stability of the product quality. A variable two stage sampling plan based on the CV is developed in this paper when the quality characteristic follows normal distribution. The optimal plan parameters of the proposed variable two stage sampling plan are determined by minimizing the average sample number (ASN) using the two-point approach on the operating characteristic (OC) curve, and then tabulated for various combinations of acceptance quality level (AQL) and limiting quality level (LQL). The efficiency of the proposed variable two stage sampling plan is compared with the existing variable single sampling plan. The results show that the proposed plan has better performance than the single sampling plan in terms of ASN. Finally, the proposed plan is illustrated with a practical example.</data>

      <data key="d3">applying the trade-o ﬀ (STOM) Abstract Reliability-based multiobjective optimization (RBMO) is a method that integrates multiobjective optimization with a reliability analysis. The method is useful for a large or complicated design problem such as aerospace structure design. Reliability analysis generally requires the probabilistic distribution parameters of random variables such as the mean and standard deviation. However, for an actual design problem, the probabilistic parameters are sometimes estimated with insufficient accuracy because of a limited number of experiments. In that case, the uncertainty in the distribution parameter is not negligible. This study proposes the evaluation method to estimate the effect of the information uncertainty at first, where the uncertainty is evaluated by using the confidence interval. Some numerical examples illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with a conventional method, Gibbs sampling. Then, the effect of the parameter uncertainty on the RBMO is illustrated through numerical examples. The RBMO problem is formulated by using the satisficing trade-off method (STOM), where the multiobjective optimization problem is transformed into the equivalent single-objective optimization method. For the reliability-based design optimization, a modified SLSV (single-loop-single-vector) method is adopted for the computational efficiency. The effects of the parameter uncertainty on the selected Pareto solutions according to the aspiration level are investigated by using the confidence intervals of the Pareto solutions.</data>

      <data key="d3">Ductile grinding of brittle materials has been demonstrated in achieving desired machining quality without deteriorating surface and subsurface quality and any post processing work. However, it is still in a low efficiency in micro-machining or conventional grinding. In this paper, a high speed diamond grinder was exploited to explore ductile grinding of SiC at a relatively higher material removal. A combination of ground surface, subsurface and grinding chips SEM observations are given to explain the high speed grinding mechanism for SiC. This study indicates that ductile grinding of SiC can be achieved through a combination of the increase of the wheel speed and the control of grinding depth. Moreover, the critical chip thickness for ductile grinding of SiC can be greatly improved under a higher grinding speed comparing to conventional speed grinding. Correspondingly, the material removal volumes can be substantially enhanced in high speed grinding while not affecting subsurface and surface integrity.</data>

Resistance spot welding is a fast, easily automated and easily maintained process with high productivity. This paper was performed to investigate the design parameters of sheet metal welded joint based on transient thermal condition. The transient thermal condition of the sheet metal was analyzed and the factor of safety was proposed at the end of the project. The design parameters included were the number of spot welding, dimension, material and thickness of sheet metal. Aluminum 5182-H19 was used as a base material to study the mechanical properties and thermal behavior. The transient thermal analysis was conducted on aluminum alloy 5182-H19 sheet metal with dimension 120mm×60mm, thickness 1mm to 6mm and number of spot weld two to five. Suitable combination of thickness of sheet metal with number of spot weld is proposed after the simulation and analysis. The CAD model and analysis of sheet metal was performed by using ANSYS software. The results of both the thermal analysis were heat flux, reaction probe and factor of safety. Scoring concept was provided to determine the number of spot weld for each thickness of the sheet metal. It is found that two number of spot weld was suitable for thickness of 1mm, 2mm, 4mm, and 6mm. As a result, sheet metal with thickness 3mm and 5mm, five and two spot weld was suitable respectively.</data>

      <data key="d3">This paper discusses properties of a preventive maintenance policy in multiple part preventive maintenance problems theoretically and numerically. A product such as a machine or an engine consists of multiple important identical parts. Parts are periodically inspected and if a part has a crack then it is either repaired or replaced with new one. If crack of a part is over the critical level then it must be replaced, because it leads to machine’s breakdown and a serious problem. In some kinds of machines, using repaired parts will incur an additional operating cost, because of decrease of its performance. Repair and operation costs are also needed for maintenance. In this paper, an optimal part repair and replacement policy is developed theoretically and numerically. The model is described and formulated as a Markov decision process. For no fixed repair cost it is divided into identical single part maintenance problems, and sufficient conditions under which a threshold type policy is optimal are presented theoretically. Then the cases that optimal policies are not of threshold type are illustrated by numerical experiments.</data>

The design parameters of the gas chamber are dominating to impact energy output and impact efficiency of a rotary hammer. In this paper, the mathematical dynamic analysis and fluid dynamic simulations were presented to analyze the influences of the sensitive design parameters on impact energy output and impact efficiency. The dynamic model of the gas chamber consists of kinematic model of impacting piston, status parameter equations of mass-variable gas volume, flow rate equation of compensation orifices, and the gas leakage equation of rubber sealing rings. A testing frame for measuring the impact energy output was designed, and the results of dynamic analysis were in good agreement with the experimental results by the testing frame. Also a successful drilling efficiency improvement of a mass production hammer was completed by adopting the valuable suggestions from this dynamic analysis.

      <data key="d3">We consider the allocation of a running time supplement to a railway timetable. Previously, Vekas et al. examined the optimal way to allocate the running time supplement. The uncertain disturbances in a railway were modeled using random variables. In their model, it was assumed that there was an upper limit to the total supplement, but its allocation was not restricted. In this paper, we suggest an improvement to the previous model and present a new stochastic programming model in which there is a constraint on the running time supplement allocated to each trip to minimize the expected delay. Then a solution algorithm to solve the problem is developed. In the previous model, allocation of the running time supplement was biased because it was not allocated to all trips. We balance the amounts of supplements for trips by adding upper and lower bounds. The fluctuations of the supplements for trips become small, and the probability of a delay decreases using our new model. Then the calculation times using the L-shaped algorithm and the former method solving a deterministic equivalent of large-scale problems are compared. It is shown that the large-scale problems can be solved effectively by using the L-shaped method.</data>

Afterwards, a supplementary design criterion is proposed for proofing against geometric interference.

      <data key="d3">This paper presents the performance characteristics of rough surface spur gears under thermo-elastohydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) with non-Newtonian solid-liquid lubricant based on a Power law viscosity model. The bi-phase lubricant contains oil with Molybdenum disulfide particles. The time dependent modified Reynolds equation, elasticity equation, powder load carrying capacity, and energy equation with initial conditions were formulated and solved numerically using a multigrid multilevel with full approximation technique for an involute spur gear. In this analysis, the normal load and overloads are applied on either two pairs or one pair of gear teeth respectively. The transitions from two pairs to one pair and vice versa are modeled as a step variation of load. The effects of solid particle concentration, diameter of solid particle and surface roughness were examined in the region along the line of action of the meshing gear. The results show that both solid particle concentration and surface roughness affect significantly the film thickness, film temperature and friction coefficient, but the diameters of solid particle are relatively insignificant for rough TEHL.</data>

To combine the evaluation results from these two different models, we introduce a re-parameterization approach which makes these models compatible with each other. We verify that the proposed method yields robust performance by comparing with the Monte Carlo simulation.

      <data key="d3">The summer season witnesses a tremendous rise in electrical power consumption. To meet this electric demand, the reduction of electrical power demand in summer by improving the efficient utilization of facilities is critical. Currently, power management and power-saving efforts in the manufacturing industry are focused on improving efficiency through replacement and improvement of equipment that consumes large amounts of energy. However, recent advances in demand response have significantly increased awareness that can lead factory managers to schedule their energy consumption efficiently by shifting electrical loads. This paper presents an optimization model for managing facility operations with shifting electrical loads in an effort to deal with the most expensive hours of the day. An integer programming (IP) model is used as a formal presentation of the problem. The results from a performance analysis of the formulation in solving problems with different characteristics are prepared, along with illustrative examples. They demonstrate how a factory manager can shift electrical loads in response to electricity prices.</data>

      <data key="d3">The use of machine tools for on-machine coordinate measurement on the workpiece is becoming commonplace. However, numerous errors can adversely affect the measurement accuracy. For instance, the inter-axis parameters are major contributors to the overall machine tool’s inaccuracy hence estimation and compensation of such errors are prerequisite to fully exploit the machine’s measurement capability. This paper presents a scheme to assess the accuracy of coordinate measurement by probing a precision sphere mounted on the machine table for different rotary axes indexations. Only the sphericity of the reference sphere is assumed and neither its size nor position. All individual probing data from all indexations are used for the assessment of the apparent out of sphericity of the reference sphere. Machine readings are processed either directly, using the machine nominal model, or using a compensated model. This provides a fast method to validate on-machine measurement before and after compensation with the exception of isotropic scale effects.</data>

      <data key="d3">Learning an image filter from a pair of images composed of an original image and its filtered version has attracted increasing attention in the image processing region. However, the existing methods only take the color information into consideration to learn an image filter, which cannot accurately depict the luminance and some style changes of images so that the generated learning results are inaccurate. This paper proposes a Laplace operator based multichannel learning approach to learn a multi-channel filter from an original image and its filtered version. Different from previous method, we adopt a strategy to learn a multi-channel filter which can accurately reconstruct the filtered image. In addition, benefiting from the Laplace regularization based multi-channel learning model, we can make the neighbor pixels of each channel have the similar weights and learn more homogeneous weight maps for each channel filter, thereby generating more accurate results with less time. Due to the multi-channel representation of our learnt filter, we can edit the luminance style and the color style of images by changing the weights of different channel filter. Furthermore, we can edit the effect of the image filters by tuning the weights of some basis filters. At last, extensive experiments well validate the performance of our method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed.</data>

      <data key="d3">The ConSurf web server (https://consurf.tau.ac.il/) for using evolutionary data to detect functional regions is useful for analyzing proteins. The analysis is based on the premise that functional regions, which may for example facilitate ligand binding and catalysis, often evolve slowly. The analysis requires finding enough effective, i.e., non‐redundant, sufficiently remote homologs. Indeed, the ConSurf pipeline, which is based on state‐of‐the‐art protein sequence databases and analysis tools, is highly valuable for protein analysis. ConSurf also allows evolutionary analysis of RNA, but the analysis often fails due to insufficient data, particularly the inability of the current pipeline to detect enough effective RNA homologs. This is because the RNA search tools and databases offered are not as good as those used for protein analysis. Fortunately, ConSurf also allows importing external collections of homologs in the form of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Leveraging this, here we describe various protocols for constructing MSAs for successful ConSurf analysis of RNA queries. We report the level of success of these protocols on an exemplary set comprising a dozen RNA molecules of diverse structure and function. © 2021 The Authors.

      <data key="d3">Energy and environmental issues have become pertinent to all industries in the globe because of sustainable development issues. This paper systematically investigates the turning process of the hardened material via process modeling, numerical experiments, and a hybrid algorithm. The objectives of this work are to reduce the specific cutting energy ( SCE ) and improve the energy efficiency ( EF ) based on the turning conditions optimization. The machining simulations were performed in conjunction response surface methodology (RSM) to generate the quadratic mathematical models of the specific cutting energy and energy efficiency in terms of machining parameters, including cutting speed, feed rate, nose radius, edge radius, and rake angle. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then adopted to examine the model adequacy and significant parameters. Subsequently, an evolutionary algorithm, namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used to find a much better spread of design solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto optimal front. A quantitative approach, namely entropy method was conducted to calculate the weight factors of multiple responses. In the last step, a TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) was applied as to determine the best compromise solution. It was indicated that the energy efficiency was significantly improved using the optimal machining parameters and the specific cutting energy was effectively decreased in comparison with initial values. Moreover, the integrative approach performed very well in optimum performance of the machining process. Therefore, this work is expected as a contribution to improve the machining efficiency of the turning process of hardened steels. Multi-attribute decision-making method, Specific cutting energy . angle were optimized in order to reduce the specific cutting energy and improve energy efficiency. A FE-based turning process model was developed to perform a set of the machining simulation based on Box-Behnken experimental designs. The quadratic models of the objectives, including the specific cutting energy and energy efficiency, were created by the mixed regression model and response surface method. The adequacy of the developed mathematical models and the important parameters were validated using ANOVA techniques. The best optimal point was determined by adopting the TOPSIS technique with entropy weights based on Pareto-optimal solutions generated by NSGA-II algorithm. The following conclusions can be drawn from this investigation within factors considered:</data>

Initially, analysis of the mechanism for variable steering input, while keeping wheel travel fixed is considered. Then, kinematic analysis is performed analytically for the ultimate case of two inputs. Analysis simultaneously for both variable steering and variable wheel travel is presented. The essential parameters; camber, caster, kingpin angles are defined according to the kinematic model. For verification, a synthesized mechanism is established in Catia software and same results with the analytical model are obtained.

The vacuum brazing technique has significant effect on the microstructure and property of the aluminum brazed joint, but there is little discussion about the optimization of the process. This study investigates how different process parameters affect the tensile properties of 6061-T6 aluminum vacuum brazed joints. The parameters including the soaking temperature, soaking time, brazing temperature, and brazing time were taken into consideration. Analysis of variance showed that soaking time is the most dominant factor. The optimal process parameters were predicted by Taguchi method to obtain the highest tensile strength. Experimental results indicated that the error between predicted and experimental tensile strength is only 0.33%. It demonstrated that the Taguchi method is feasible for obtaining the optimal process parameters of aluminum vacuum brazed joints.

Our clinical observations of RTX/OFA‐mediated loss of the CD20 target from circulating CLL cells have been replicated in our in vitro studies. Here we describe flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy experiments, which demonstrate that acceptor cells, such as monocytes/macrophages that express FcγR, remove and internalize both antigen and donor cell‐bound cognate IgG mAbs for several different mAb‐donor cell pairs. Fluorescent mAbs and portions of the plasma cell membrane are transferred from donor cells to acceptor cells, which include the THP‐1 monocytic cell line as well as freshly isolated monocytes. We describe rigorous controls to validate the reactions and eliminate dissociation or internalization as alternative mechanisms. Trogocytosis is likely to contribute to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver damage associated with use of antibody‐drug conjugates. The methods we have described should allow for examination of strategies focused on blocking trogocytosis and its adverse effects. © 2023 The Authors.

      <data key="d3">In this paper, we consider a multi-hop sensor network, where the network topology is a tree, TDMA (time division multiple access) is employed as medium access control, and all data generated at sensor nodes are delivered to a sink node (the base station) located on the root of the tree through the network. It is reported that if a transmission schedule that avoids interference between sensor nodes completely can be computed, TDMA is preferable to CSMA / CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) in performance. In general, the TDMA scheduling problem to ﬁnd the shortest schedule is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, where each combination corresponds to a schedule. However, solving such a combinatorial optimization problem is dif-ﬁcult, especially for large-scale multi-hop sensor networks. The reason of the di ﬃ culty is that the number of the combinations increases exponentially with the increase of the number of nodes. In this paper, to formulate the TDMA scheduling problem, we propose a min-max model and a min-sum model. The min-max model yields the shortest schedule, but it is di ﬃ cult to solve large-scale problems. The min-sum model does not guarantee providing the shortest schedule; however, it may give us good schedules over a short amount of computation time, compared to the min-max model. Numerical examples show that the min-sum model can provide good schedules in a reasonable CPU time, even when the min-max model fails to compute the shortest schedule in a reasonable CPU time.</data>

      <data key="d3">It is usually di ﬃ cult to correctly segment medical images with intensity inhomogeneity, which is of great signiﬁcance in understanding of medical images. The local image intensity features play a vital role in accurately segmenting medical images with intensity inhomogeneity. Therefore, it is crucial to acquire the local intensity features for a deeper understanding of medical images. The main idea of this paper is to construct an e ﬃ cient similarity-based level set model, which synthesizes the similarity theory, curve evolution and level set. Firstly, a local statistical function is modeled as di ﬀ erent scales of Gaussian distributions to estimate bias ﬁelds, in which a real image can be approximately obtained for a more accurate medical image segmentation. Secondly, a new potential function is constructed to maintain the stability of the curve evolution, especially the signed distance proﬁle in the neighborhood of the zero level set, which plays an important role in the correct segmentation. Thirdly, an adaptive condition criterion has been proposed to accelerate the convergence in the curve processing. Finally, the experiments on artiﬁcial and medical images and comparisons with the current well-known region-based models are discussed in details. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can correctly segment medical images with intensity inhomogeneity in a few iterations and also is less sensitive to the initial contour.</data>

      <data key="d3">Rescue robots that can penetrate into narrow gaps in the rubble, create and maintain spaces for rescuers after earthquakes are urgently needed in search and rescue missions. This paper proposes two novel rescue robots, including a cutting robot and a jack robot, which are used to cut obstacles and jack up heavy debris in hazardous locations and in narrow spaces, where rescuers cannot work or approach. Firstly, a multi-linked tracked, or snake-like rescue robot platform is designed, which is composed of modular crawler vehicles connected by active and passive joints with three degrees of freedom. This rescue robot platform has high mobility on irregular terrains and the ability to move into narrow collapsed structures. Then, portable rescue tools including an electric cutter and a novel electric screw jack are designed. In order to perform operations to the tools, manipulators with multi degrees of freedom are also developed. Consequently, the cutting robot and jack robot are realized by equipping the corresponding rescue tool and manipulator in the rescue robot platform. Finally, field tests of the two rescue robots operating on different terrains and performing rescue missions are carried out in the national training base for urban search and rescue. The results validated the mobility, cutting and lift-up capacity of the two rescue robots. The experiments show that they might play some role in rescue operations.</data>

      <data key="d3">The vibration acceleration and temperature changes of the sliding parts of a vane-type hydraulic pump were measured simultaneously, including under the operating condition in which vane tips became detached. The test pump was a compact vane pump with 12 vanes having a theoretical displacement of 9.4 ml/rev, a maximum discharge pressure of 21 MPa, and a maximum rotational speed of 30 s. The vanes were inserted front to back into the slots of the pump rotor in order to allow ease of detachment. An acceleration pickup was affixed to the cam ring. In addition, four thermocouples were embedded in the cam ring, and four thermocouples were embedded in the side-plate. A hydraulic oil with ISO VG32 was used as the test fluid, and the inlet oil temperature was set to 40–60°C. The rotational speed was set as high as 15 s. The discharge pressure was increased in 1 MPa increments up to 10 MPa, and the oil temperature and rotational speed were held constant until detachment occurred. The experimental results revealed that detachment of the vane tip from the cam ring was easy to occur at lower discharge pressure under the conditions of high oil temperature and low rotational speed. When the vanes began to repeatedly and violently detach and reattach, the cam ring temperature instantly decreased and subsequently increased markedly, while the vibration acceleration increased greatly.</data>

      <data key="d3">In model-based product development, engineering models representing specific parts a product from diverse aspects and resolutions are used to reduce cost and lead time while systematically reducing design alternatives. Designers in the product development processes will benefit from these models if they are timely available. In order to utilize these models collected from past development processes, we propose a product development process simulation method, which computationally supports planning of the current product development process. In the proposed method, these models are used to identify the types of design tasks and dynamically instantiate them so that they can satisfy given product specifications. The method is integrated with estimation of the degree of progress in product development by using a set-based approach. The simulation procedure performs iterative updates of the degree of progress with a traversal search on the graph, which is made by extracting the attributes and their relations defined in these models, and connecting these models at the attributes in common. The use of the proposed method is illustrated through its application to the development of a wind turbine.</data>

      <data key="d3">This paper extends the maximum flow-covering location and service start time problem (MFCLSTP) by additionally imposing a minimum stay at a facility before the service can be used. The original formulation determines the locations of facilities and the start times of fixed-duration services so as to maximally cover flows of commuters who access services on the way home from work. In MFCLSTP, commuters must stay at a facility from the start of the service until the end of the service in order to consume it. Examples of such services include movies, lectures, and baseball games. There are, however, many on-demand services, which can be consumed by commuters who access the providing facility for a fixed continuous duration of a hours during any of c (≥ a) open hours of the facility. To deal with this situation, we extend the definition of coverage in the original model and provide an integer programming formulation of the proposed problem. The model is applied to the Tokyo metropolitan railway network, using census data of commuter traffic for railway users in this area. Exact optimal solutions are obtained by using a mathematical optimization solver with both the original and extended problems, and the characteristics of the solutions are compared. The results show that the optimal solutions for the extended problem allow a much larger flow than the optimal solutions for the original problem do, even when a is very close to c. The locations selected for the optimal solutions of the proposed problem are seen to be much more spatially dispersed than those chosen for the original problem.</data>

      <data key="d3">A demand for a nanoscale patterning method with high throughput exists for the fabrication of next-generation devices. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a major breakthrough for obtaining the nanoscale pattern because of its high resolution and simple process. Because the resolution of NIL depends on the features of the master mold, it is very important to prepare a fine mold. Electron beam lithography (EBL) is typically used for the fabrication of NIL molds because EBL has a resolution of sub-10 nm. However, EBL is low throughput process and performed in a vacuum; it is difficult to obtain a large mold via EBL. On the other hand, direct laser writing (DLW) performed in the atomosphere is also promising method for the fabrication of a NIL mold because DLW can fabricate an arbitrary pattern in a large area. However, it is difficult to achieve the resolution of sub-100 nm with DLW because of a diffraction limit. To fabricate a fine mold in a large area, we have developed a miniaturization technique of a replica mold made of an elastic UV-curable resin using mechanical deformation. Although, the miniaturization of a line and space (LS) pattern of several hundreds nm width was already demonstrated, the miniaturization characteristics of a several micron and sub-100 nm width pattern are not examined. In this study, the deformation characteristics of the LS pattern with the micron and sub-100 nm width are examined. As a result, it became clear that our miniaturization technique can apply to the micron pattern. In addition, we succeeded in reducing the size of an LS pattern with a line width of less than 50 nm.</data>

      <data key="d3">Abstract Lunar/planetary spacecraft should be able to land softly and conduct thorough explorations. Conventional landing methods suffer from various problems such as high rebound, the impossibility of reuse, and necessity of air. Therefore, a novel landing method that solves these problems is required for landing in severe environments. Toward this end, the authors have applied Momentum Exchange Impact Damper (MEID). MEID realizes landing by exchanging the momentum of the spacecraft with damper masses. However, flying damper masses may collide with and damage the spacecraft. Furthermore, they may pollute the lunar/planetary surface. Therefore, in this paper, the authors propose a Non-Flying-Type MEID (NFMEID) mechanism without flying damper masses. Unlike conventional landing methods and MEIDs, the NFMEID (i) reduces a spacecraft's rebound, (ii) can be reused, (iii) can be used in vacuum, and (iv) can protect a spacecraft and the surface pollution from launched masses. Furthermore, the NFMEID may extend the usefulness of MEID because it is considered effective for the shock response control of not only spacecraft but also general mechanical structures. This paper explains the NFMEID mechanism and evaluates its landing performance through some simulations. This study shows that the NFMEID is a promising landing method for further lunar/planetary exploration missions.</data>

The results of experiments revealed that the proposed brace mechanism did not change the position of the ankle joint when a force was applied to the foot so that pain could be avoided.

      <data key="d3">Offline and online quality control are vital aspects to maintain quality since they help to reduce the deviation of the target product and to avoid any out-of-control manufacturing conditions. In contrast to extant studies which only highlighted the importance of online quality control, this study proposes a new comprehensive model for process selection. It incorporates both offline and online quality controls, an excellent balance between the costs, tolerance as a quality requirement, and delivery time. In particular, the proposed model tries to optimize the total cost, which comprises the design, prevention, manufacturing, inspection-correction, and finishing costs as well as the loss of quality, by considering the tolerance and delivery schedule. This model then selects the process with the cheapest total cost, a tolerance level that is more lenient than the tightest tolerance, and a reasonable delivery time. A distinguishing feature of the presented model compared to other studies about process selection is that the costs are related to the product design, which makes this model compatible with more than one product design. The model is also robust to changes in some of the parameters. Therefore, it can be implemented in numerous situations.</data>

      <data key="d3">In this study, we theoretically and experimentally explore the acoustic leak of an entire acoustic system as well as the various gap occurring between a gasket and flange. We conducted the first-ever fundamental research related to sound transmission loss through a narrow gap between a gasket and flange. In the experiments, we constructed pipeline elements, including the gap and the leakage path, in the impedance measurement tube. In the theoretical analysis, we replaced the fluid path, including the gap, with acoustic elements that comprise an electrical equivalent circuit. We then conducted the analysis using the transfer matrix method. To calculate the attenuation of sound waves propagating through the gap, we considered friction in association with viscosity, primarily in the boundary layers of the inner wall, to derive the characteristic impedance and propagation constant. The trends between the calculated and the actual experimental values for transmission loss in the entire acoustic system coincided enough with regard to a large gap size range between 0.01 and 0.2 mm. Furthermore, the transmission loss linearly increased with the decreasing logarithm of gap for the calculated regions. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis and experimental results show agreement for incline gap conditions between the gasket and flange. The maximum gap also greatly affects the acoustic transmission loss for the inclined gaps. This was confirmed both by the experimental and the calculated values. We consider that these results provide fundamental acoustic knowledge specific to the narrow gap between the gasket and flange in an acoustic system.</data>

We designed a model-based PID closed-loop control method using feedbacks from six uniaxial force sensors installed on limbs. Three simulations were proceeded to estimate the feasibility of this control method. Furthermore, we established two series of experiments, including multi-dimensional loading experiments and standard tension tests. The former experiment results demonstrate the multi-axial loading capacity since the actual multi-axial output wrench has the deviation less than 5% of the desired ones. The latter experiments reveal that the uniaxial tension test is not considerably influenced by the redundant degree of freedoms, because the tensile-test results are relatively identical to those results achieved by universal material testing machine.

      <data key="d3">This paper proposes a new optical angle sensor, in which a mode-locked femtosecond laser referred to as the optical frequency comb is employed as the light source for the sensor. By using the optical frequency comb, whose carrier frequency is well stabilized by using an external frequency standard with the uncertainty of 10, both the sensor stability and the sensor sensitivity are expected to be improved. In this paper, the angle error caused by the frequency fluctuation of the laser beam is considered in the case of both the mode-locked femtosecond laser and a laser diode, which is a conventional light source for the optical angle sensor. A prototype optical sensor head with the mode-locked femtosecond laser is then fabricated for the angle sensor. Since the light wavelength of the mode-locked femtosecond laser used in this paper is out of the visible range, an alignment method based on laser autocollimation with a retroreflector is introduced to determine the zero-position for the angle sensor. This method is also effective in suppressing the influence of the alignment error such as a cosine error. Some basic experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the developed angle sensor with the optical frequency comb.</data>

However, solving problems is generally difficult, and feasible methods for finding analytical solutions are needed. The purpose of this study is to propose a hybrid method that combines pseudo particle swarm optimization in an uncertain environment (PPSOUCE) and the Monte Carlo (MC) method for solving a stochastic programming problem. As an example, we used the proposed hybrid method to solve a stochastic job-shop scheduling problem (SJSSP). We compared our proposed PPSOUCE with the MC method to a hybrid method of a genetic algorithm in an uncertain environment (GAUCE) with the MC method. Numerical experiments illustrate that our method provides better solutions with shorter CPU times than those of the method that combines the GAUCE and the MC method.</data>

      <data key="d3">This paper deals with a fabrication method in additive manufacturing (AM). Generally, a large model must be segmented into some parts featuring connector shapes in case that its size is over the fabrication area of AM device. However, the connector portion of each segment is usually the weakest portion in strength because it becomes thinner or narrower than the original shape. In this study, the connector design and fabrication method is investigated in consideration of the strength depending on the deposition direction in AM. Since the most parts fabricated by AM with plastic materials have anisotropic property in strength, the strength of the part can be designed by the build orientation in AM. In this paper, after the concept of the parallel fabrication that is the basis of the segmentation planning is introduced, the anisotropy of strength is evaluated with tensile and fracture tests. Then, the factor of fracturing is discussed by using stress simulation with the finite element method. Finally, the appropriate connector design is proposed and the effectivity is discussed.</data>

      <data key="d3">Although assembly line is widely used for several decades since it appears during the Industrial Revolution, nowadays, it still has the vitality, especially in the developing countries such as China, where labor-intensive enterprise is still the mainstay industry. Assembly line has its advantages for reducing costs and production time. However, laborer is the main factor of production speed in such a labor-intensive enterprise. Because of the various working capacity of worker, one work process may delay or idle, and this will influence processes. This unforeseeable consecutive delay of process may lead to the postponing of whole manufacturing production. In order to minimize the risk, the assignment of the workers, especially untrained worker is focused on. In previous researches, rules of optimal worker assignment with two kinds of workers, which are distinguished by the capacity of processing, were proposed when minor untrained workers are less than four people. In this paper, we deal with the rules under this LCMwMP (limited-cycled model with multiple periods) model without concerning the number of minor untrained workers. Additionally, some rules of minor well-trained workers assignment optimization are researched by numerical analyses.</data>

      <data key="d3">Chatter is one of the main limitations to milling performances. Prediction of such unstable phenomenon via stability lobe diagrams requires the measurement of the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) for each tool and machine tool setup. This paper presents a hybrid FE-experimental approach to identify tool-tip FRFs with only one set of measurements, taking into account tool change without any other experimental test. Machine tool dynamics is modeled using a Finite Element (FE) approach. Machine, spindle and tool-holder are described by a lumped model characterized by frequency-dependent stiffness, while the tool is FE modeled. Lumped model and tool are connected by means of stiffness matrices extracted using the Craig-Bampton dynamic reduction method. The obtained simplified model of machine tool enables chatter prediction by means of stability lobe diagram for different tool without the need for extensive experimentation. Once a new tool is clamped no other measurements are needed, just the new tool FE model. Experimental validation under different conditions is provided, showing accuracy and reliability of proposed approach.</data>

In this method we consider the stability of the path tracking control system under the limitation of steering angle, so that drivers can drive safer and more comfortable. In order to do this, we have derived linearized system from the nonholonomic kinematic system by the di fferential flatness consideration and linear control law which stabilizes the path tracking control system. Furthermore, feedback gains are tuned to satisfy the closed loop stability and the limitation of the steering angle by using Particle Swarm Optimization. Usefulness of the proposed control method has been demonstrated by experiments using a 1 / 0 scale robot car.</data>

In this paper, a novel foil thrust bearing using multi-decked protuberant foils as supporting structure is developed and tested. Experimental bearing test rig using gas-driven high speed turbo-expander is set up to evaluate static loading characteristics of the bearing. Static stiffness, friction torque, nominal bearing clearance and axial vibration amplitude are discussed in the transient processes. Static loading characteristic of the bearing is evaluated based on the relationship between displacement and loading force.

      <data key="d3">Several methods of evaluating the motion accuracy of the rotary axes of five-axis machining centers have been proposed in past studies. Because it is known that particular motion errors exist near motion direction changing points, it is important to evaluate the behavior of the rotary axes near these points. However, the influence of the motion error of the translational axes is included in conventional evaluation results because the translational axes reverse at the motion direction changing points about the rotary axes. In this study, a measurement system for evaluating the dynamic characteristics of the rotary axes near the motion direction changing points about these axes, excluding the influence of the translational axes, was developed. The measurement tests were also conducted using this measurement system for evaluating the dynamic characteristics of the tilt axis near the motion direction changing points about this axis. In addition, an actual machining test was conducted to evaluate the influence of the motion errors of the tilt axis near the motion direction changing points. As a result, it was confirmed that the behavior of the tilt axis near the motion direction changing points can be evaluated by using the proposed measurement method. It was also confirmed that the influence of the motion error on the machined surface is related to the size and shape of the tool and the geometric relationship between the motion error and the machined surface. It was also confirmed that the machined shape does not always contain defects when motion errors exist depending on the relationship between the motion error and the machined surface.</data>

      <data key="d3">The local mean decomposition (LMD) is a new method of adaptive time-frequency analysis, which was proposed by Jonathan S. Smith and applied to the analysis of electroencephalogram and achieved a desired result (Smith, 2005). The LMD method decomposes a complex multi-component signal into series of Product Functions (PFs), and the instantaneous frequency of each PF has physical meaning. Each PF is the product of an envelope signal and a frequency modulated signal, the envelope signal is instantaneous amplitude of the PF, and the instantaneous frequency can be derived from the frequency modulated signal. Combining the envelope and the instantaneous frequency of all PFs, a time-frequency distribution of the original signal can be obtained. The PFs decomposed by LMD method are actually simple component amplitude and frequency modulated signals, which contain different frequencies of the original signal. The LMD method is very suitable for the analysis of non-stationary signals, which essentially decomposes a multi component non-stationary signal into a series of simple component stationary signals (Cheng, et al., 2009 ). The arc electrical signals in square wave alternating current submerged arc welding contains rich welding quality information, which is a common source signal in welding quality monitoring. The welding arc current and voltage signals has characteristics of short circle and high frequency with reasonable physical meaning, which are easy to be collected and also directly related to the welding quality. Reference (Li, et al., 2000) realized the identification of welding defects through arc sensing, which can be used in the on-line monitoring of welding process. Reference (Li, et al., 2012) and reference (He, et al., 2013a) used the wavelet energy entropy and Lyapunov exponent as quantitative index to realize the evaluation of the arc stability based on welding current signals in submerged arc welding. Because of the uncertainty influencing factors of the welding quality and complex noise background during the collection process, the actually collected welding arc signal has the characteristic of nonlinear and time-varying, which is a typical non-stationary signal (He, et al., 2012, He, et al., 2013b, He, et al., 2016).

      <data key="d3">In single‐molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), immunofluorescence (IF) staining affects the quality of the reconstructed superresolution images. However, optimizing IF staining remains challenging because IF staining is a one‐step, irreversible process. Sample labeling through reversible binding presents an alternative strategy, but such techniques require significant technological advancements to enhance the dissociation of labels without sacrificing their binding specificity. In this article, we introduce time‐lapse imaging of single‐antibody labeling. Our versatile technique utilizes commercially available dye‐conjugated antibodies. The method controls the antibody concentrations to capture single‐antibody labeling of subcellular targets, thereby achieving SMLM through the labeling process. We further demonstrate dual‐color single‐antibody labeling to enhance the sample labeling density. The new approach allows the evaluation of antibody binding at the single‐antibody level and within the cellular environment. This comprehensive guide offers step‐by‐step instructions for time‐lapse imaging of single‐antibody labeling experiments and enables the application of the single‐antibody labeling technique to a wide range of targets. © 2023 The Authors.

      <data key="d3">1. Abstract This study investigates the robust topology optimization of the thin plate under concentrated load with uncertain load point. Several researches investigated the effect of uncertain load direction, load magnitude or load distribution on the topology optimization. However, the robust topology optimization considering uncertainty of the load point has not been studied yet. In this study, the load point uncertainty is modelled through the convex hull model. The nominal concentrated load in out-of-plane direction is applied at the center of the plate modeled based on Reissner-Mindlin plate theory. The load point uncertainty is limited in a circle centered at the nominal load point. The worst load condition is defined as the applied load at the worst point in the convex hull that gives the worst value of the mean compliance. The worst point is easily obtained from the convex hull approach. Then, the robust objective function is formulated as a weighted sum of the mean compliance obtained from the mean load condition and the worst compliance obtained from the worst load condition. This robust topology optimization is constructed using the level set-based topology optimization method. Through numerical examples, the robust optimum configuration is compared with the deterministic optimum configuration. Then, validity of the proposed robust design method is discussed.</data>

      <data key="d3">Clickable glutathione is a glutathione‐derived chemical probe designed to identify and analyze protein S‐glutathionylation, a major cysteine oxidation in redox signaling. An engineered glutathione synthetase mutant (GS M4) is used to synthesize clickable glutathione in cells or in vitro, which affords utility via click chemistry to detect, identify, and quantify glutathionylation on individual or global proteins in biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses. The clickable glutathione approach is valuable for the unequivocal identification of glutathionylated cysteines, among many reversible cysteine oxoforms, via the direct enrichment and detection of glutathionylated proteins or peptides. Clickable glutathione, in combination with GS M4, has demonstrated utility in the mass‐spectrometry‐based discovery and profiling of new proteins and cysteines for glutathionylation in cell lines in response to physiologic and oxidative stress. The approach is versatile and applicable to validating the glutathionylation of proteins and cysteines in other biochemical analysis beside mass spectrometry.

We then discuss and analyze the wheel and the track mobile modes and their switching design of the EPW. The use of the track mobile mode is primarily for climbing up and down the stairs while the wheel mobile mode is for commonly ground surfaces.

      <data key="d3">To improve the wear resistance of small machine parts such as microscale gears, we developed a novel surface treatment process, laser-induced local surface treatment. Disk-shaped austenitic stainless steel (SUS316L) specimens were soaked in Al(NO3)3 solution and subsequently irradiated by a nano-pulse fiber laser beam. The treated surfaces were then observed under a scanning electron microscope and analyzed using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The effects of defocus amount, tribology behavior, and wear resistance on the characteristics of the treated surface were examined in detail. The surface roughness of the treated specimens with the defocus range of -1 to -2 mm was lower than that of the treated specimen without defocus. The thickness of the treated layer decreased when the defocus amount was increased within the abovementioned range of values. However, when treatment was performed with a defocus amount of -3 mm, no noticeable change was observed on the treated surface; this was attributed to the difference in laser-energy density. The friction coefficient of the laser-treated specimen with the defocus level of -1 mm was much lower than that of the untreated specimen. This implies that the wear resistance of austenitic stainless steel can be improved with the proposed surface treatment method.</data>

      <data key="d2">Xinbo CHEN; Jun YIN; Wei WANG; Lixin WU; Feng TANG</data>
      <data key="d3">Benefit from quick response of motor torque and torque vectoring control, distributed drive electric vehicles (EVs) have a good potential to realize ABS, ESP and Traction control, and thus to achieve better driving performance. The drivetrain layouts of distributed drive EVs can be mainly divided into on-board motor drive system and wheel side drive system. With elimination of classic differential and drive shaft, the transmission chain of the wheel side drive system is relatively short and it doesn’t occupy space of the car body, and thus it features high efficient and compact. Therefore, the wheel side drive system is a prospective application on distributed drive EVs. However, the wheel side drive systems are normally equipped with a low speed hub motor or a high speed motor with reducer. These would bring in a large unsprung mass. Research pointed out that moving the electric propulsion from the vehicle body to the wheels can add up to 50kg or more, per wheel, to the unsprung mass (Van Schalkwyk and Kamper, 2006). The driving characteristics of a vehicle can be greatly improved by reducing the unsprung mass (Heißing and Ersoy, 2010). With the increased unsprung mass, the ride comfort and especially the road holding ability (or in other word driving safety) of a vehicle are worsen (Han, 2002; Guo, 2012; Fang, 2012; Liu, et al., 2012; Rojas, et al., 2010; Ślaski et al., 2014). This is so called “large unsprung mass negative effects”. Researchers and companies are devoting to diminish large unsprung mass negative effects. An axial flux disc motor is used to reduce unsprung mass of distributed drive EVs (Eastham et al., 1995; Hredzak, et al., 1998). As shown in Fig. 1(a), ZF released an early concept study of electric twist bean for Close-to-Wheel drive EVs at the IAA Abstract Ride comfort and road holding ability of distributed drive electric vehicles are worsened due to large unsprung mass introduced by wheel side drive system. To diminish this large unsprung mass negative effects, three approaches (“Suspension and Reducer Integrated” Close-to-Wheel Drive System, “Dynamic Vibration Absorber” Close-to-Wheel Drive System and in-wheel drive system with “Active and Energy Regenerative Suspension”) are introduced. The corresponding dynamics are analyzed and the schemes are provided. Evaluations of suspension performance show the superiorities of these approaches in different magnitude compared with the conventional configuration which is equipped with hub motor and passive suspension. Overall comparisons between three approaches are carried out and the feasibilities are discussed. With proper design</data>
